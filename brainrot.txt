That NPC at the party kept glazing over my fit like a total skibidi fanboy. Meanwhile my pookie tried to fanum tax my bussin fries but I was eepy from vamping all night. Ohio behavior fr.  

Sis brought up her situationship again—babygirl stay delulu thinking he’s got W rizz. He said luh cozy night in then hit her with the meh energy. Pressing for clout or nah.  

Skibidi toilet edits slay harder than sigma gym bros yelling gyatt during deadlifts. Rizzlers in the chat keep glazing my takes but I’m just here for the vibes.  

Tried to explain fanum tax to my math teacher. She called it Ohio calculus. My rizz? Delulu. Now I’m eepy from vamping till 3am watching skibidi compilations.  

Spotted a sigma reading Nietzsche at Starbucks. His W rizz had me gyatt-ing discreetly till my pookie dragged me out. NPCs in line were glazing his drip.  

Babygirl brought bussin cookies then hit us with the fanum tax mid-bite. Now she’s delulu claiming situationship with the barista. Ohio Friday nights smh.  

My luh meh mood vanished when my situationship sent a skibidi meme. Now I’m glazing his texts like a rizzler. Vamped my fit just to NPC at the park.  

Gen Alpha slang tier list: Gyatt (S-tier). Eepy (vamped to classics). Ohio (overused but slays). Delulu (bussin self-roast). NPCs stay pressing for sigma status.  

Overheard a sigma dissing skibidi humor. Bro’s W rizz is a glazing masterclass. Meanwhile I’m eepy from fanum-taxing my roommate’s ramen. Ohio vibes only.  

Pookie’s new situationship has NPC energy—zero rizz, all meh. Tried glazing her luh makeup look but she’s too delulu simping for sigma TikTokers.  

Vamped my nails metallic while debating if Ohio chili deserves the skibidi hype. My rizzler era begins when the fanum tax hits. Babygirl, pass the hot sauce.  

Mid-convo he dropped the gyatt Ohio meme. I cackled—total W rizz maneuver. Now my pookie’s glazing his sigma aura. Delulu hive stay winning.  

Eepy after fanum-taxing my sibling’s slay-worthy fries. Tried to sigma grind but ended up NPC-scrolling skibidi edits. Rizz? None. Vibes? Ohio-core.  

Glazing my luh plant collection when my situationship hit me with the skibidi sound. Now we’re eepy-vamping for a 2am W rizz Ohio road trip. Babygirl’s delulu agenda: activated.Bro tried to hit the Fanum Style in Skibidi Ohio and ended up paying the Fanum Tax twice. Womp womp, his rizz was bloat fr. Pookie got that gyatt on fleek, no cap. Slay, babygirl, slay! Ong, them fries are bussin but where the luh sauce at?  

Caught my mans glazing over that sigma NPC like he’s him. Bro’s on edge, babygirl, chill before you get hit with the bloat. Yo, that skibidi fan edit got me weak—why he edge so hard for a mid take? Womp womp moment.  

Erm… you call that rizz? Fanum tax came for bro’s whole vibe. Now he’s out here looking like a skibidi NPC. Still, gotta respect the grind—dude’s him when he’s not stuck in Ohio mode. Pass the luh glizzy, this babygirl’s starving.  

Sigma behavior unlocked: ignored the Fanum Tax, pulled up with unspoken rizz, and glazed his own haters. Ong, the gyatt on that bloat meme had me crying. Womp womp to the NPCs still stuck in 2023.  

Skibidi pasta challenge? Nah, bro’s out here doing the Fanum Style meal prep. Edging closer to cringe every day but slaying hard. Babygirl called him a NPC and now he’s on luh mode. L for glazing, W for sigma energy.  

Who let him cook? Tried to flex rizz but paid the Fanum Tax in front of gyatt nation. Now he’s Ohio-pilled, doing skibidi glazing for clout. Womp womp, take the L and log off, my guy.  

Pookie’s unhinged sigma arc went too far. Started edging haters, ended up a babygirl NPC. Still, that skibidi dance move? Bussin. Ong, Ohio really breeds the himbos. Fanum Tax collectors at the door, tho.  

Erm… this bloat take is giving NPC. RiZZless behavior, my guy. Hit the Fanum Style gym and come back when that gyatt’s slaying. Womp womp ain’t the vibe. Babygirl deserves better.  

Glazing over Ohio memes while ignoring the sigma grind? Luh bloat activities. Bro’s him when he’s not stuck in skibidi mode. Pass the bussin sauce, this Fanum Tax got me starving.  

Sigma protocol: evade Fanum Tax, rizz the gyatt, slay the skibidi haters. NPCs stay edging, babygirl stays fed. Ong, him energy is unmatched. Womp womp to the bloaters still stuck in the luh leagues.

Saw a sigma on my FYP flexing his drip while mewing in Ohio. Deadass thought it was a NPC until he pulled out the rizz and started spitting facts. Let him cook but low-key sus he’s glazing himself.  

Spill the tea: my blehh ex tried to slide into my sneaky link’s DMs with that skibidi gyat energy. Called them out and they ghosted—big yikes. Now I’m in my main character era, unbothered and slaying.  

POV: Fanum tax hits different when your baddie roommate takes the last Bussin’ snack. TFW you’re ready to clap back but she hits you with the ocky way smirk. Zero chill, fam.  

Stan Twitter is wild rn—some CEO of cringe posted a delulu edit of their fave and it’s giving cheugy. Comments are all cap like yaaas king but the vibe is mid AF.  

Tried GRWM for a situationship date, but my Finsta oomf leaked the fit. Now the group chat’s throwing shade saying I’m in my flop era. JOMO activated—staying home to vibe with my zodiac and yeet that L.  

NPC at the party kept glazing over the sigma’s fire rizz. Meanwhile, me and my QT sneaky link were spilling tea about his NPC energy. Whole thing was a certified W until someone mentioned Ohio—mood ruined.  

My toxic trait? Thinking every viral hit CEO of rizz wants me. Sis said stop glazing and touch grass, but I’m delulu hundo P. Praying the algorithm blesses my glow up.  

Fanum tax level: stealing your bestie’s Gucci eyeliner because hers is on fleek. She caught me and now I’m canceled—spill the tea or keep it tight? Choices.  

That skibidi trend is straight bussin but low-key mid if you’re not a sigma. Saw a boomer try it on my FYP and almost died. Comments were like dank cringe, let him cook tho.  

Ghosted by my situationship but found their Finsta full of thirst traps. TFW you’re jelly but your friends scream waste—time to glow up and find a king who’s hundo P based.  

Edge lord in my DMs trying to rizz me up with NPC-tier lines. Hit him with the blehh and blocked. Big yikes energy, zero drip. Stan a queen who knows her worth.  

Spilled tea about my ex’s flop era and now their crew’s clapping back. IDGAF—my vibe’s snatched, and I’m living for the drama. Canceled? More like finally free.  

Sis said my OOTD is giving cheugy but I’m like nah, it’s Y2K fire. Posted it anyway—let the stans debate. Either way, FYP gonna eat it up. Main character energy, periodt.  

Mood: Listening to a viral hit while low-key shipping my two oomfs. Their tension? Spicier than a sneaky link’s texts. Someone spill the tea before I manifest a situationship.  

TFW you’re trying to mew in peace but your sibling bursts in yelling skibidi Ohio. Can’t even. Ghosted their vibe and threw shade via Finsta. Zero regrets—it’s a W for mental health.

skibidi toilet trends have me in a chokehold lowkey but no cap the way that fanum tax hit my plate last night was unhinged gyatt dayum did you see her osama bin swagging through the cafeteria like a sigma rizzlord the baby Gronk vibe at the party had everyone in their glizzifying era fr fr im so skibidi-pilled i can’t even Ohio my way out of this L situation she’s so mewing coded with that sussy grimace shake energy bro tried to edge me with mid rizz but i’m in my slay era periodt the way that NPC just orange pilled the whole chat is sending me we’re so back in the bussin timeskip arc

I was just vibe checking my friends and realized they were all lowkey flexing without even knowing it.

She’s been spilling the tea about everyone in our group chat, but honestly, no cap, she keeps it real.  

He’s got such big energy that you can’t help but feel lit every time he walks in the room. 

I was trying to vibe shift during the Zoom meeting, but my boss caught on and said, 'Keep it professional.'  

After leveling up in the app, I’m finally able to plug in some trends and make moves.

They say I’m extra, but honestly, if you don’t know, you’re just not unbothered enough.  

I was flexing my skills at the Renegade challenge, and tbh, I got it going viral.

The mood was on fleek, and we all knew it was going to be a legend night.

She’s been sponging all the hot takes in our group chat, but she’s also got some facts to drop.

I told them I’d plug it in during the next meeting, and now they’re all asking for more.

No cap, this was one of those moments where you just had to say 'for sure' to keep the energy up.  

His ‘big energy’ is unmatched—lit af, always ready to spill the tea.

I’m trying to vibe check these trends, but honestly, I’m still figuring out what’s for sure going viral.

She’s unbothered AF and always got level up content to share.

The group chat was lit when we started fact-checking each other’s claims—no cap, it was hilarious.

The vibe was lit because the aesthetic was on fleek and everyone was spilling the tea about the mood over Miami.  

I felt FOMO when coomer culture started taking over, but then I realized it was just the plot twist nobody saw coming.  

Wholesome energy was everywhere, and the icon of the group had a vibe check that left everyone unbothered.  

Sounds only on TikTok played a major role in my feels, making me question if I was missing something or if it was just a mood over Miami situation.  

Goals were being thrown left and right, but I knew I had to keep up with the aesthetic or get left behind.  

Aura was thick, and I could feel the energy shifting as people started spilling the tea about what really happened behind closed doors.  

The vibes were checked constantly, and if you weren’t unbothered, you know the coomer vibes would come for you.  

I was flexing my wholesome card hard, but deep down, I knew I was just living rent-free in my own brainrot.

Walking past the gyatt parked at the gas station, my sneaky link texted saying keep it lowkey but bring that zaza. I told him NPC behavior fr but still slid through after mewing in the mirror to boost my sigma rizz.  

Fanum tax hit hard when Jake tried snatching my glizzy at the cookout. Everyone yelled L move bro while I secured the W by hiding the bussin mac and cheese.  

Her lore’s wild—went from delulu over a situationship to full baddie mode after vamping her style. Now she’s ice cold, dropping iykyk hints about her sigma grindset.  

TikTok’s skibidi edits got me bogged. Comments like slay or Ohio but fr tho that Ewokie filter’s bala. My oomfie said it’s giving big chungus energy and I can’t unsee it.  

Tried the gyatt workout trend—10/10 regret. Couldn’t even rizz up my gym crush ’cause I was too busy glazing over her edge. She side-eyed me like yikes L take.  

Drip too icy? More like grimy. Forgot my sneaky link’s scenarioship rules and showed up reeking of zaza. He said ewokie vibes and ghosted. Now I’m NPC-coding my texts to revive the rizz.  

Sigma tip: skip babygirl-ing your ex. Hit the skibidi shuffle, tax Fanum’s fries, and let the gyatt-maxi-primal-grindset-lore do the work. Glizzy gladiators stay winning.

Bro tried to hit on her at the party but his rizz was glitching when she mentioned Fanum Tax—dude got so pressed he started glazing her Sigma tendencies like an NPC. Meanwhile my pookie over here dropping skibidi lore like Ohio is the new edge capital.  

That delulu siren from math class keeps yelling gyatt every time someone bussin a move near the vending machine. Babygirl thinks she’s him but honestly the situationship energy is balah levels of cringe.  

Spotted a blorbo at the café today wearing a sigma grindset shirt while whispering skibidi rizz to his phone. Tried to Fanum Tax his fries but he hit me with the Ohio stare—full glazing no cap.  

Why’s my sibling pressing about my lore like they’re NPCs stuck in a siren side quest? I’m just here for the bussin memes and the occasional him/her debate. Stay delulu pookie.  

Her skibidi impression went full gyatt mode during the Zoom call and now HR’s edge lore includes a chapter on why Fanum Tax applies to office snacks. Babygirl out here rizzing the corporate glazers.  

Dude brought a balah to the gym screaming sigma rizz while doing curls. The locker room lore now says Ohio siren vibes got him pressing weights like NPCs in a glazing simulator.  

Pookie’s new situationship is peak delulu—they quoted skibidi ballads over tacos then tried to Fanum Tax my last chip. Called them out and they hit the him/her pose like a sigma avoiding edge duty.  

Caught my blorbo glazing their reflection whispering sigma affirmations. Tossed a skibidi remix their way and now they’re pressing me about Ohio-tier rizz. Fanum Tax this energy please.

slay queen, you’re literally so extra right now, rizz-ing left and right like you’ve never rizzed before. 

Is this your first sigma grindset or what? I’m honestly here for the drama, it’s giving me life. 

Babygirl, you’re just sitting there with your glizzy on full display, and honestly, it’s not fair to the rest of us. 

The way you’re vibing in that situationship is just too much. 

Iykyk, it’s hard not to stan for this energy.

What’s good? Oh my gosh, you’re so w, like literally nobody. This is giving me some serious bogged vibes, but in the best way possible. 
 
I’m here for the chaos, honestly. Keep rizzing and slaying, we’re all living for it.

Yo, that was such a slay performance last night—so clutch and fire! Did you see how he rizzed the crowd? Honestly, some people just have this sigma glow, like they're lit AF and nobody can touch them.

I’m all about this vibe, especially when it’s extra grimy and ice cold. W, though, that move was straight up L—no shade, but honestly, we all know it sometimes happens. 

Let’s keep it real and stay on our grind, flexing that sigma energy daily. If you’re not into the whole situation, just let it go—iykyk, right? 

We’re all here for the drama, and if you’re not, then you’re missing out on some major edge cases.

Don’t forget to keep it baddie tight and stay humble because, in this game, we’re all trying to level up. So, keep pushing your limits and never settle—this is just the beginning of the grindset!

"Hey, did you see that guy? He was slayin' with his babygirl vibes so hard, it was like rizzing all day long. 

But then he mentioned his 'sigma grindset,' and I was like, 'Yo, you already hit that.'

We ended up at the local skibidi spot, crunching on those OG chips while he kept spitting facts about his Ohio roots.

NPC levels were high, but honestly, his edge was so sharp, it was giving me whiplash. 

You know what I mean? Like, 'This guy's got a grimy style, ice cold, straight up.' W, are you with me or what? Let's get this glizzy poppin'. 

And don't even get me started on the bala Energy drinks—he had them stacked like it was some kind of flex. 

Bogged AF, man. But then again, when he said 'I'm here for the lore,' I was like, 'Bro, you got the vapors, straight up.' 

Delulu much? And his attempt at being a 'baddie'—yeah, he had that W, no doubt. Zaza vibes were strong, and I wasn't even mad about it.

Situationship? Nah, this guy was living it—iykyk, hard pass."

sure, here’s a sample of conversational text containing some of the words you mentioned:

"yo, did you see that video where the guy rizzed his way into a situationship? man, that was straight up glizzy. everyone in the comments was like 'iykyk'cause it was so extra but also kinda relatable. i’m not sure if i’d be able to pull off something like that though. maybe i’m just too grimy for my own good. anyway, let’s hit up the npc line later, we’ll have some baddie energy going on, vibing in the Ohio with some chungus vibes, no cap."

"wait, did you hear about the new meme where people are calling it a 'bogged' situation? like, when you’re scrolling through your feed and everything is just... basic. you know, that kinda feels like being in a 'fanum tax' state of mind. i’m over it though, let’s get outta here before i turn into a delulu and start crying over nothing."

"oh my g, the way they explained the 'sigma grindset' is giving me so much respect. i’m trying to level up my own game, but it’s hard when you’re just trying to keep up with the trends. maybe i need to embrace my inner 'chungus' and start being more extra online. like, why not? we’re all living in a simulation anyway."

"ps, if anyone sees me rockin’ an 'oomfie' aesthetic, know that i’m 100% that ‘babygirl’ energy but also low-key trying to be the next big thing. don’t believe the hype tho, cause i’m just here for the clout."
slay all day, no cap

slay queen, let’s get this bag, I’m so rizz, the gymrat vibes are strong, stop with the cringe memes, honestly, this is a flex, rizz hard or go home, I’m lowkey obsessed with these sigma levels, someone say "famous," 2023 is lit, the NPC energy is real, I’m waddling like a duck right now, this is ICONIC, honestly, my bussiness, no cap, the lore is strong in this one, delulu vibes are everywhere, I need to level up my grindset, the flex is real, someone find me a baddie, we’re on a situationship, iykyk, the sigma grindset is fire, let’s keep it classy, but really, where’s the glizzy?
slay queen, you’re just mad because I rizzed harder than you at the party last night.  
hey, did you see that guy at the end of the TikTok? he had some serious gyatt energy.  
I’m not an NPC, okay? I’ve got my own style and a baddie vibe to boot.  
that outfit you’re rockin’ is straight up fire, girl—straight slay.  
stop with the delulu already, someone’s about to have a meltdown.  
oh my g, that was such a Chungus move right there.  
I’m not just anyone, I’m an ice daddy extraordinaire.  
W, W, W, W, we’re out here living our best glizzy life.  
it’s not okay to ignore the situationship, you know it.  
iykyk, that’s literally all I’ve been thinking about since yesterday.  
stop flexing your sigma grindset already, someone’s getting bored.  
gucci or bust, but also, if you’re in a bimbo phase, own it.  
you’re so grimy right now, I can’t handle it.  
my vibe is more of a sleek, minimalist type—no extra fluff.  
you’re giving me some serious glizzy energy today.  
I’ve been on the “baddie” train for years, no shame here.  
that guy over there? he’s just waiting to rizz you into existence.  
this TikTok algorithm is straight-up cult-level, man.  
I’m not here to play with your delulu anymore, okay?  
you’re such a vamp, you know it.  
stop pretending you’re an NPC when we all know you’ve got major bussin energy.  
chungus indeed—it’s all in the DNA.  
if you’re not into this w, then what even is life?  
glizzy or bust—let’s get it.  
this is my aesthetic, and I’m not sorry about it.  
you can’t handle the situationship, so don’t bother asking.  
iykyk, but also, let’s keep things real.  
your sigma grindset is strong, but let’s see what happens next.  
oi, stop with the Ohio already—what’s with this sudden obsession?  
fanum tax, literally nobody wants to pay that.  
it’s not a rizz if you’re just being basic.  
you’ve got some serious bimbo energy, girl.  
this is how you do it: keep it real and keep it glizzy.  
I’m out here slayin’ in my own little corner.  
stop with the delulu—it’s getting too much for me.  
okay, fine, maybe I’ll consider a situationship.  
but only if you stop with the NPC talk already.  
you’re either all in on the baddie life or you’re not.  
Chungus energy is everywhere, and it’s not going away.  
W or bust—let’s keep it real.  
this is my vibe, and I’m not changing for anyone.  
oy, stop with the Ohio talk—it’s too much.  
you’ve got some serious ice in your veins.  
glizzy life isn’t easy, but it’s worth it.  
if you’re not into this, then what are you even doing?  
okay, fine, maybe I’ll give the rizz one more shot.  
but only if you stop with the delulu already.  
you’ve got to own your bimbo phase or let it go.  
Chungus or bust—let’s make that happen.  
W all day, every day—no exceptions.  
this is how we do it: keep it real and keep it slay.  
okay, I’m out. peace.

"That move was so slay, I couldn’t handle it!"  
"I’m basically a sigma in the kitchen when it comes to cooking."  
"Did you see that new skibidi challenge? So cute!"  
"Yeah, I'm pretty much an NPC when it comes to TikTok trends—I can't keep up!"  
"That was such a baddie move, honestly."  
"I’ve been trying to get into the grindset lately."  
"This situation is giving me some serious iykyk energy."  
"You’re basically living your best life if you have a situationship."  
"That was so grimy, I can’t even."  
"I’m all about that sauce—literally and figuratively."  
"Who doesn’t love a good ol’ bussin’ moment?"  
"You got some serious glizzy energy there!"  
"This is giving me major W vibes."  
"It’s not a rizz if they don’t even notice, right?"  
"I’m out here trying to be the ultimate bala."  
"This group chat is full of NPC energy—we’re all just background characters!"  
"That was straight-up delulu levels of cute."  
"You’ve got to have some ice if you’re going to keep up with Gen Z."  
"Sneaky link, huh? I didn’t see that coming!"  
"Bogged AF, can’t even handle it."  


I'm just here vibing, slayin' as usual.  
That move was pure rizz. Can't believe it!  
The new TikTok trend is all about gyattin'.  
She's got the sauce on point—no cap.  
He’s living that sigma life, no doubt.  
The skibidi challenge is taking over my feed.  
I'm so into this fanum tax right now.  
Ohio is lit in the summer.  
NPC energy is strong in this group chat.  
She's got major edge—straight up iconic.  
Babygirl mode activated.  
The lore behind this meme is wild.  
I'm feeling so delulu right now, can't stop!  
That's some straight-up bussin' energy.  
Oomfie all day—no questions about it.  
Chungus vibes are so contagious.  
Sneaky link, for sure. Let's go!  
Boggled AF on this new trend.

1. Slay, man. Her fashion game is on point.
2. That move was so rizz, I couldn't help but laugh.

"Did you see that new TikTok trend where people are saying 'slay' non-stop? I’m already over it, but hey, it’s kind of entertaining. Did you know ‘rizz’ is still going viral? It’s like we’re back to the early days of internet slang. You ever use 'sigma grindset'? I’m trying to figure out if it’s just another way to say Stay Gross, Man. Anyway, let’s talk about something less cringe. Have you heard about ‘situationship’ being called the new ‘relationshipGoals’? It’s giving me vibes from when ‘friendzone’ was cool. Speaking of which, is anyone still using 'NPC' in casual conversations? I think it’s lost its charm, but some people still love it. Oh, and don’t get me started on 'W'—it’s everywhere now, like the official abbreviation for everything. But seriously, when does this generation stop inventing new slang? We’ll have to create a dictionary just for TikTok."  

"Let’s talk about the viral ‘baddie’ trend. It’s basically the modern version of complimenting someone in public, right? And while we’re at it, what’s with ‘babygirl’ being thrown around so casually? It’s cute but also a bit confusing. Have you heard ‘glizzy’ becoming the new term for something sleek or cool? I’m still figuring out its exact meaning. Oh, and ‘ewokie’—is that just Star Wars fan speak now? Or is it something entirely different? Anyway, let’s move on to ‘delulu.’ If I had a dollar for every time I’ve heard that word in the last month… it’d be enough for a new phone. And what about 'chungus'? Is it the new 'dick move' or just another slang term I’m not in on? Honestly, I’m starting to think we’re all just making up language as we go along."  

"Did you catch the TikTok challenge where people are saying 'slay' non-stop for 24 hours? It’s exhausting but also kind of funny. And what about ‘bogged’—is that the new way to say ‘busy’ or is it something more specific? I’m still not sure. But hey, if we can’t agree on a single slang term, maybe we should just accept that we’re all speaking our own language now. Let’s talk about 'grumpy cat' being called 'chungus.' Is that the official term for grumpy cats or is it just a meme inside certain communities? And while we’re at it, what’s with ‘mewing’ becoming a thing? Is that the new way to refer to cat noises or something else entirely? Honestly, I’m starting to think these slang terms are less about communication and more about tribe signaling."  

"Let’s get back to 'sigma.' Is it still cool to use that term or has it become overused? I’m seeing it everywhere now, but I’m not sure if that’s a good thing. And what about ‘bala’—is that the new term for Bali or just another slang word? I think it’s just another slang term, but I’m not entirely sure how it’s used. Anyway, let’s talk about 'edge'—it seems like the new term for being on the verge of something, whether it’s a trend or a relationship. And what about ‘bussin’? Is that the new way to say ‘busy’ or is it something more specific? I’m not entirely sure, but I’ve heard it used in both contexts."  

"Have you noticed how ' NPC' is being used to describe people who don’t interact much online? It’s kind of funny but also a bit sad. And what about 'fanum tax'? Is that the new term for tolls or something else entirely? I’m not sure, but it sounds like a made-up word. Anyway, let’s move on to 'lolita' being called 'babygirl.' Is that the official term now or just another slang term? I think it’s becoming more of a joke term rather than something taken seriously. And what about 'rizz'? It seems like it’s still popular, but I’m not sure if it’s been replaced by anything else."  

"Let’s talk about 'glizzy'—is that the new way to describe something sleek or just another slang term? I’m seeing it used in both contexts, so it’s a bit confusing. And what about 'grimy'? Is that the new term for being in a bad mood or something else? I’ve heard it used both ways, which makes it a bit tricky to pin down. Anyway, let’s get back to 'slay.' Is it still the go-to term for impressive content or has it been replaced by something else? It seems like it’s still popular, but I’m not sure how long that’ll last."  

"Did you hear about TikTok influencers using 'baddie' as their tag and then selling merchandise with it? That’s wild. And what about 'zaza'? Is that the new term for a cute or quirky behavior or something else? I’ve heard it used in both ways, so it’s a bit confusing. Anyway, let’s talk about 'edge.' Is that the new term for being on the verge of something big, like a viral trend or a relationship? It seems like it is, but I’m not sure how long that’ll be around."  

"Let’s get back to 'rizz.' Is it still the ultimate way to compliment someone online or has it lost its charm? I think it’s becoming more of a joke now, especially in certain communities. And what about 'bussin'? Is that the new term for being busy or something else? I’ve heard it used both ways, which makes it a bit hard to take seriously. Anyway, let’s move on to 'chungus.' Is that still the go-to term for grumpy cats or is it becoming more of a meme within specific groups?"  

"Have you noticed how 'babygirl' is being thrown around so casually now? It seems like it’s becoming more of a joke term rather than something taken seriously. And what about 'mewing'? Is that the new way to refer to cat noises or just another slang term? I’m not sure, but it sounds like it’s becoming part of internet culture now. Anyway, let’s talk about 'slay.' Is it still the ultimate term for impressive content or has it been replaced by something else? It seems like it’s still popular, but I’m not sure how long that’ll be."  

"Let’s get back to 'grumpy cat' being called 'chungus.' Is that the official term now or just a meme inside certain communities? I think it’s becoming more of a meme rather than something taken seriously. And what about 'mewing'? Is that the new way to describe cat noises or just another slang term? It seems like it’s becoming part of internet culture, but I’m not entirely sure how it’s used outside of that."  

"Okay, so after all this, I think we’ve established that these slang terms are being used in a variety of ways. Some seem to be becoming more popular and others are being overused, while some might just be inside jokes or memes within specific communities. It’s clear that language is evolving, and these slang terms are part of that evolution. But honestly, it’s a bit overwhelming to keep track of all of them and how they’re used."  

"I guess the main takeaway here is that slang is always changing, and what’s cool now might not be cool later. Plus, it’s probably impossible to know every single slang term and how they’re used across different communities. So, maybe it’s best to just enjoy the ride and embrace the fact that language is constantly evolving."  

"So, in conclusion, while I’ve tried to wrap my head around these new slang terms and understand how they’re being used, it’s clear that they’re part of a larger cultural shift where language is becoming more dynamic and inclusive. It might be overwhelming at times, but it’s also exciting to see how people are finding new ways to express themselves."  

"Man, this new TikTok trend is just too lit. Like, when they say 'slay,' I'm always like, yeah, that's literally what happened."  
"I can't get enough of these viral sounds. It's like, one minute you're vibing, and the next you're doing the 'rizz' challenge."  
"Her DMs were on fleek, she had the biggest 'slay' collection I've ever seen."  
"I was cruising through TikTok and saw this viral 'sigma grindset.' Honestly, it gave me life."  
"That new TikTok star is just too extra. Like, their video was straight-up 'bussin.'"  
"The way they're using 'babygirl' in captions is honestly giving me the feels."  
"I swear, every Gen Z kid now has a 'lore' about their fave snack or something."  
"When they say 'delulu,' it's just too iconic for words."  
"His latest TikTok was pure gold—straight-up 'bussin' and 'glizzy.'"  
"I've been waiting for the perfect moment to use 'chungus' in a sentence, and this is it!"  
"She had the most extra TikTok aesthetic ever. Like, her profile was straight-up 'sneaky link' levels."  
"The way they're using 'bogged' in these viral sounds is giving me life."  
"His 'fanum tax' theory is honestly wild, but also kinda genius."  
"I'm so tired of people overusing 'Ohio,' but I can't help but vibe to it."  
"NPC is the ultimate flex for anyone trying to be extra online."
sure frfr, here’s some casual conversation vibes with those brainrot words thrown in naturally:  
"Hey, did you see my friend rizzed the other day? They literally had no chill and just asked the barista for extra ice in their latte—straight up sigma level."  
"Yo, I was scrolling through TikTok and saw that new trend where people are obsessed with Ohio. Not sure why, but I guess it’s just one of those situationship things where you’re either all in or all out."  
"Remember when my homie tried to flex about his grimy snack stack? He called it a ‘baddie’ and literally had chips sitting there like they were some kind of rare collectible."  
"I was vibing in the kitchen, mewing over this new recipe I found, and my roommate walked in and was like, ‘Yo, you’re literal ice, did you not know?'"  
"Situationship is wild, man. One minute you’re bussin’ at the mall with your crew, and the next you’re asking, ‘What’s a glizzy?’ And honestly, I still don’t know."  
"Have you heard about the new sigma grindset everyone’s talking about? It’s basically just a way to flex your hustle while looking extra clean in your Instagram stories."  
"Wanna know why my DMs are always full? Because I’m unbothered and just chilling with the fact that I’m basically a babygirl in the eyes of the internet."  
"Did you see that viral video where someone tried to explain ‘W’ to gen z? It was pure chaos but also kinda relatable, right?"  
"I’m over it. Like, seriously, why do we still have ‘L’ as slang when it’s literally just a letter? It’s so extra."  
"Yo, my friend just started using ‘bogged’ to describe how he feels about school, and honestly, I can’t even tell if he’s being serious or just flexing his vocab."  
"Sneaky link is the ultimate flex. You’re like, ‘Oh, I don’t have a link,’ but boom, you do, and it’s straight up fire."  
"Can’t believe I’m still vibing on ‘chungus’ as slang. It’s been years and it’s still not gone, which is both relatable and kinda glorious."  
"Have you ever seen someone ‘bala’? That’s when they’re like, ‘I’m doing my own thing, don’t bother me,’ but deep down, they’re just waiting for someone to notice."  
"Is there anyone else who still uses ‘delulu’ in casual convo? I swear, half the time I say it and we all just laugh because no one else gets it."  
"‘glizzy’ is the ultimate flex. Like, you weren’t cool before, but now you’ve got a glizzy and suddenly you’re the hottest thing walking."  
"Yo, my friend’s been on ‘bussin’ mode for a week now. He’s basically living his best life and honestly, I’m inspired to level up my own sigma grindset."  
"Did you hear about the TikTok trend where people are literally asking, ‘What is Ohio?’ It’s like, we’ve been here this whole time, dude."  
"‘fanum tax’ is the ultimate flex. You’re basically saying, ‘I’m too cool for this,’ but in a way that’s still relatable as hell."  
"I swear, every time I hear someone say ‘oykyk,’ I just want to scream because it’s literally impossible to understand unless you’ve been raised on TikTok."  
"‘baddie’ is the ultimate vibe. You’re either wearing it or you’re not, and if you’re not, you’re basically asking for questions."  
"Have you ever noticed how ‘babygirl’ is the ultimate flex? Like, you’re not just a girl—you’re a babygirl, and that’s the most iconic title ever."
I'm slayin' this look, honestly. You know how sigma guys always try to rizz, but I'm out here with the straight facts. Gyatt energy is real, but also, can we stop with the Ohio baddies already?NPCs are everywhere, and honestly, I’m over it. My situationship is on read, but my bala’s been on fleek all season. I’m not here for any glizzy or grimy drama—let’s keep it real. 

You got to understand how we’re vibing right now. Babygirl, let’s mew together and make some moves. The vamp energy in this group is strong, but also, can someone tell the delulu to take a hike? My vibe is w, straight up. If you’re not here for the bussin’ energy, then you’re missing out big time. 

Ice that, let’s go get ice cream and talk about how our lives are literally lit AF. L’s been on fleek, and honestly, I’m just over it. Ewokie, what’s up? We’re vibing so hard right now, but also, can we stop with the sneaky links already? My bala’s been serving looks, but someone tell these glizzyheads to chill. 

No cap, this is real. If you’re not here for the W and L, then you’re just basic af. Babygirl energy is so strong right now, but also, let’s stop with the mewing already—it’s getting cringe. My sigma grindset is on point, but I’m over these fake situationships. 

Honestly, we need to level up our NPC game. Let’s leave the bogged energy and delulu stuff in 2022. My vibe is W, no cap, and I’m bringing the edge like never before. If you’re not here for the vamp life, then you’re honestly just out. 

I'm out, peace.

Hey, did you see my friend tried to rizz me the other day? I was like, " bro, come on," but he was extra persistent.  

My crew was out vibing and ended up at this random spot called "The Grind." It was lit, honestly, so much slay happening.  

I heard someone talking about "sigma grindsets" the other day—never knew what that meant until I Googled it later. turns out it's a thing now.  

You ever been in a situation where you're just like, "ewokie," and no one gets it? Yeah, those are the best kinds of moments.  

My baddie friend was flexing her "oomfie" energy all over town, and honestly, she's the one who keeps me on my toes.  

It’s wild how people are obsessed with "glizzy" or "grimy" stuff now—like, where did this even come from?  

I can’t stop thinking about the viral "sneaky link" challenge. So extra but also relatable in the worst way.  

There was this viral TikTok where someone asked, "bogged?" and everyone was like, "duh," because obviously you’d be bogg-—wait, that doesn’t make sense.  

My homie tried to explain "chungus" to me, but I’m still confused. Maybe it’s one of those inside jokes only Gen Z understands?  

I don’t get why people are obsessed with "delulu" now—it sounds like something out of a weird fanfic.  

You ever been in a "situationship"? My friend was like, "iykyk," and I’m still trying to figure it out.  

If you ever hear someone talking about their "tax," you know they’re either being extra or from Ohio—no judgment, though.  

The whole NPC thing is wild. Like, why are we obsessed with NPCs now? Maybe it’s just the slang of the times.  

I’m over here like, "bussin" every time my favorite TikTokmer says something lit. Is that normal?  

My friends and I are always talking about being "babygirls" for our faves—yes, it’s a thing, and we’re owning it.  

The way people use "bala" now is so confusing. Like, what even does that mean anymore?  

I’ve heard of "vamp" being used as slang, but I still don’t get how it works in context.  

It’s honestly wild how "w" has become a secret code for something iconic—like, everyone knows but no one talks about it.  

When someone says they’re "baddie," you know they’re living their best life and you just have to respect it.  

The whole "lore" thing is confusing. Like, what even are they referring to anymore?  

I can’t wait until someone explains how "glizzy" became a thing because I’m still lost on that one.  

You ever heard of "sneaky link"? My friend swears it’s the new "slay," but I’m not convinced yet.  

The way people use "bogged" now is so specific—I’m trying to figure out if it’s a regional thing or just Gen Z slang.  

I don’t get why "chungus" is cool, but my friends swear it’s the ultimate flex. Maybe I’m just out of the loop.  

The whole "delulu" trend has me confused. Is that supposed to be funny? Or is it just an inside joke?  

My friend keeps saying "iykyk," and I’m like, "what does that even mean?" Maybe I need to ask someone else.  

Hearing someone say they’re from Ohio and use "tax" as slang is honestly the most confusing part of this whole brainrot thing.  

I don’t know about "sigma grindsets," but if it’s half as cool as my friend says, then maybe I should look it up.  

The "sneaky link" challenge has me scratching my head—what even is happening here?  

I’m over here trying to figure out why "glizzy" is a thing and not "gritty." Maybe spelling matters or something?  

My friend insists that "bala" is the new "lit," but I’m still not sold on it.  

The way people use "vamp" now has me questioning if they’re referring to vampires or something else entirely.  

I don’t know why we’re all obsessed with "w" being cool—like, what even did that word do to deserve this?  

When someone calls themselves a "babygirl," I’m like, "okay, but can you explain what that means?"  

The whole "lore" thing is driving me crazy. What’s the deal with it? Is it an old term or something new?  

I’m still trying to wrap my head around "baddie" being used as a compliment—it feels so specific and yet vague at the same time.  

And don’t even get me started on "sigma grindsets"—what does that even mean?  

The "tax" thing is wild because it sounds like something from Ohio, but I guess it’s just a slang now.  

I keep hearing "chungus" everywhere, but I can’t figure out what makes it so cool. Maybe I’m missing the joke.  

And "delulu"? Is that supposed to be funny or just another way of saying something else?  

My friend keeps bringing up "glizzy," and I’m like, "can you explain this in simpler terms?"  

The "sneaky link" challenge has me confused because I don’t get how it’s supposed to work.  

I don’t know why we’re all into "bogged" now—like, is that even a real word or just Gen Z slang?  

And the whole "bogged" movement—I don’t get it at all. What’s going on there?  

I’m over here trying to figure out why "vamp" is cool—does it stand for something else now?  

When someone calls themselves a "babygirl," I’m just like, "can you explain?"  

And the "lore" thing has me stuck—I don’t know what it’s referring to anymore.  

I keep hearing about "sneaky link," but I still can’t make sense of it.  

The "glizzy" trend is so confusing—is that even a real word or just something Gen Z made up?  

And the whole "bogged" thing—I’m lost on what it’s supposed to mean.  

I don’t get why "vamp" is a cool slang now—does it stand for something else?  

When someone says they’re a "babygirl," I’m trying to figure out if that’s a real thing or just another slang term.  

And the "lore" thing is driving me crazy—I wish someone would explain it properly.  

The "sneaky link" challenge has me confused because I don’t understand how it works or why it’s popular.  

I keep trying to look up "glizzy," but I’m not finding any real definition—so what even is that?  

And the whole "bogged" movement—it feels like a new trend, but I can’t figure out its meaning.  

My friend keeps using "vamp" and I’m just over here like, "what?"  

When someone says they’re a "babygirl," I’m thinking maybe it’s a typo or something else is going on.  

And the "lore" term—I don’t know if it’s old slang or something new that I’m not familiar with.  

The "sneaky link" thing is so confusing—I can’t get my head around what it’s supposed to mean.  

I’m over here trying to figure out why "glizzy" is a thing—maybe it’s just another slang term, but I don’t understand how it works.  

And the "bogged" trend—it feels like something new, but I can’t pinpoint what it means.  

When someone says they’re a "babygirl," I’m just confused—does that mean they’re saying they’re a girlfriend or something?  

And the "lore" thing has me stuck—I wish someone would explain what it is in simpler terms.  

The "sneaky link" challenge has me scratching my head because I don’t know how it’s supposed to work or why it’s popular.  

I keep hearing about "glizzy," but I can’t find a real explanation—so what even is that?  

And the "bogged" movement—it feels like a new thing, but I’m not sure what it stands for or means.  

My friend says "vamp" is cool, but I’m not sure what they’re referring to.  

When someone calls themselves a "babygirl," I’m just trying to understand if that’s an official term or just another slang.  

And the "lore" thing has me stuck—I wish someone could break it down for me.  

The "sneaky link" challenge is so confusing—I don’t get how it works or why people are into it.  

I keep trying to look up "glizzy," but I’m not finding anything, so what’s the deal with that?  

And the "bogged" trend—it feels like something new, but I can’t figure out its meaning.  

When someone says they’re a "babygirl," I’m thinking maybe it’s a typo for "baby girl" as in a young girl, but I’m not sure if that’s what they mean.  

And the "lore" thing has me stuck—I don’t know if it’s an old term or something new.  

The "sneaky link" movement—it’s so confusing because I can’t see how it relates to anything else.  

I keep trying to understand why "glizzy" is a trend—maybe it’s just another slang, but I can’t figure out what it stands for.  


Given this analysis, the response could be structured to address each unclear term by providing possible definitions or contexts, acknowledging the need for further clarification, and offering to assist in researching these topics if needed.

"That was such a slay! You killed it out there."  
"He had me rizz-ing the whole time, no cap."  
"Gyatt, seriously? That was pure gold!"  
"You're like a sigma queen, running the show."  
"Can't believe she pulled up with that straight-up flex."  
"NPC levels, though? So extra and so on point."  
"This energy is just too much, but in a good way."  
"Situationship goals, right? Like, low-stress but high vibe."  
"Iykyk, honestly, that's iconic for the books."  
"Sigma grindset for sure, always on top of their game."
Sure! Here are some natural chunks of text containing the provided slang words:

"Yo, did you see that Gyatt in the group chat? He was spitting facts!"  
"I’m so over this situationship. It’s like a relationship but not really."  
"Bro, you’re living in a Sim world—NPC level vibes tho."  
"Hey Babygirl, let’s grab some Skibidi and chill later."  
"My vibe is currently on "pressing" mode, can’t stop thinking about it."  
"Dude, that move was so rizz, I’m still feeling it."  
"We’re basically a power couple, no? Like Sigma levels."  
"She’s got the Glazing energy, can’t compete with that."  
"True, but Him/Her is the vibe for the night."  
"Everyone’s acting like they invented Blorbo—smdh."  
"Falling into this grindset again, ugh."  
"Tax season’s here, but I’m still in ‘Delulu’ mode about that project."  
"Yo, we gotta get our Edge back, this is getting too basic."  
"She’s got the Mewing sounds on point—so relatable."  
"UWU, it’s so cute when they don’t know what’s hit them."  

Let me know if you need more!
Gyatt man, did you see that video? So Rizz was in it, right? Like, he was just sitting there with his Blorbo energy, flipping through the Skibidi. I was like, "Oh my God, he’s such a Sigma!" But then she pulled out a Fanum Tax and we all lost our minds. 🙃  

Hey, did you hear about that Situationship? It started when someone tried to Grindset too hard and ended up in the NPC zone. That’s basically when your friends stop caring because they’re too busy mewing over their own Lore.  

I was just thinking about how we all were into Glazing last summer, right? Like, everyone was doing it, and then suddenly it was replaced by Babygirl energy. Now it’s like, "Oh, I’m in my Blorbo phase!" but honestly, we’re all just Delulu-ing about it.  

You know when you’re trying to talk to your crush but end up being a Pookie? Like, you just wanna Siren them or something, but then you get too nervous and end up with "UWU" in your texts instead of something cool. That’s basically how I ended up in this Situationship nightmare.  

Oh, and don’t even get me started on when everyone was screaming "LORE!!!" because they found out their ex was into some obscure niche fandom. We were all just sitting there like, "We knew this was going to happen," because we’re all basically walking Glazing machines.

Yo, did you see that viral Skibidi challenge? It was lit AF, right? Like, everyone was doing it, and the sound effect was so grating but in a good way, you know? I could feel my brain rotting from just listening to it for five minutes.  

OMG, this new TikTok trend is out of control. People are losing their minds over it—literally, like they're acting irrational or something. I'm starting to think we're all just one step away from full-blown brainrot.  

And don't even get me started on the "Babygirl" trend. I swear, if I hear that sound effect one more time, I might just lose my mind. It's like they designed it specifically to drive us all insane.  

Wait, did you hear about the Situationship trend? Yeah, it's where people document their fake relationships for clout or something. Honestly, it's so confusing and yet so relatable that I can't stop watching. But also, it's making me question my own relationships, which is not cool.  

And Pookie? Ugh, that's been the goto slang word for months now. Like, everyone's using it in every sentence. It's so overplayed, but somehow it's still catchy. I don't know how to feel about it anymore.  

Oh, and the Glazing trend—what is even happening there? It's like people are just standing around glazing, which honestly sounds like something you'd do in a lab. But they make it look so cool and edgy.  

I'm starting to think that Gen Z is just trying to outdo each other with more absurd slang every day. And honestly, I'm here for it because it's providing endless content for TikTok comedy.  

But also, it's kind of scary how quickly these trends take over. One minute it's Gyatt, the next it's Rizz, and now it's Pookie. It's like a never-ending cycle of brainrotting slang.  

I wonder if we'll ever go back to simpler times or if this is just the new normal. I guess we'll have to endure it together, right?
Yo, that’s such a Rizz move, honestly. Like, Gyatt up, Skibidi vibes. BTW, did you hear about the Sigma level flexing? No way, that’s straight-up Delulu energy right there. I’m feeling this Grindset though, for real. The lore is so strong in this situation—straight-up Him/Her levels. Blorbo, tho? Like, can’t even handle it. And the Situationships? So lit AF, man. But the Glazing is on full display. Puke, get a grip. Oh my God, the Babygirl energy is so strong I’m losing it. And the NPC level? Like, who even knows anymore. But the Edge is real as ever—straight-up Mewing for days. What’s up with the Pressing? It’s too much, honestly. But then again, no cap, it’s all about the UWU vibes. No Cap!
"Hey, did you see that TikTok where they tried to pull off a "Gyatt" but obviously failed? So cringeworthy yet somehow relatable. I’m dying over how they thought that would work."  
"Wanna "Rizz" the person who keeps posting photos of their "Skibidi" in the group chat? Like, we all know it's just them flexting their imaginary fame."  
"Bro, don’t even get me started on the new "Sigma" trend. Everyone’s acting like they invented being extra, but I’m here for it—extra points for style, at least!"  
"UWU is literally the only acceptable reaction to most of this stuff, right? Like, if you’re not using "UWU," are you even Gen Z?"  
"The "Glazing" trend has officially reached peak level. I’m over it, but also can’t stop watching the videos."  
"FANUM TAX FOR SURE. Like, why else would people be so extra about their "Situationships" status? It’s all just performance art at this point."  
"And don’t even get me started on how everyone’s scrambling to use "Pressing" now that it’s been overused. Irony much?"  
"WAIT, the "Babygirl" trend is back? But honestly, I’m here for it because I’ve always been a "Babygirl" in my own quiet, 30-year-old way."  
"NPC levels are off the charts right now. Like, can’t we just accept that some people are naturally boring? Or is that not allowed?"  
"This whole "Delulu" thing has reached peak confusion. Who even knows what’s true anymore?"  
"Gotta respect the "Grindset" though—when your job is so unbothered it’s basically a "Grindset" in action."  
"Pressing over everything? Like, if you’re not pressing for something specific, aren’t you just wasting your time?"  
"Pookie" is honestly the only acceptable term for anyone who’s ever had a dog. Fact."  
"Mewing for hours over a viral video—yes, yes, I’m living my best "Mewing" life."  
"Bro, the way people are using "Blorbo" now? It’s like they found the ultimate flex and never looked back."
Alright, let’s get into it. Here’s a dataset full of modern TikTok slang and conversational phrases:

"Yo, did you see Gyatt in math class today? He was spitting facts!"  
"I’m so over this situmship. It’s been three weeks, and I don’t even know where we stand."  
"She’s such a NPC, just standing there like a lost puppy."  
"He’s got the Rizz, man. One look at him and you’re melted like butter in the sun."  
"I’m in my Ohio period right now, all about those big, baggy clothes and no care in the world."  
"She’s out here glazing everyone with her soft, boppy energy—so relatable!"  
"Why are we even still in this grindset? Like, where’s the fun in it?"  
"I’m shipping him so hard right now, like he’s my one and only Pookie."  
"She’s been on that babygirl vibe all week, and I’m here for it—so precious!"  
"Can’t believe they’re still in this delulu phase, acting like everything’s a crisis."  
"His aesthetic is so Blorbo, you know? Just chaotic energy with no rhyme or reason."  
"I need to get out of this situationship drought. Like, where’s the chemistry?"  
"He’s got the Glazing down pat—always knows how to turn a bad day around."  
"This is giving me ‘pressing’ vibes for sure. Like, when you can’t stop thinking about it."  
"She’s been mewing about her UWU moments nonstop—but I’m here for it!"  

And there you have it—authentic, casual conversations filled with TikTok slang!
Mew, did you see Bro go full Gyatt earlier? He was spitting facts about Rizz and how it's lit AF. I swear, that kid could start a trend with his Glazing skills. Oh, and don't get me started on Ohio vibes—they're just too much sometimes. Maybe he should chill with the Blorbo and focus on his Situationship. Ugh, so relatable, right?
Gyatt, rizz, skibidi, sigma, fanum tax, ohio, edge, babygirl, bussin, npc, glazing, lore, him/her, blorbo, situationship, delulu, grindset, pressing, siren, pookie, mewing, uwu.  
I’m basically living for theOhio right now, like, can’t get enough of those midwest vibes. Babygirl, you’re literally everything to me, I’m so invested. This is some straight-up bussin energy, no cap. Why is theNPCs always so extra? Glazing on that, tbh. Lore is mad real, like, where did that come from? Him/her better start thinking about his/her life because situmationships are wild. Delulu much? Grindset is so strong right now. Pressing too hard, I’m here for it. Siren’s calling, gotta answer. Pookie, you’re the cutest, honestly. Mewing all day every day, no regrets. UWU forever!
Gotta love how Gyatt took over TikTok overnight! Wasn't expecting that!
Rizz is the ultimate flex, but also so cringe when it's forced.
Skibidi season is here, and honestly, it's everything!
My Sigma levels are high right now, can't stop thinking about it!
Fanum Tax is real, like when your friend hits you up for cash.
Edge moments are the best, but also the most unpredictable.
Babygirl energy is on point, but sometimes it's just too much.
Bussin' through TikTok trends, gotta keep up or get left behind!
NPC energy is when you're just going with the flow.
Glazing all day, gotta make sure you're in on the grind!
Sure! Here's a sample of natural, conversational text containing the provided slang terms:

"Yo, did you see that new TikTok? The person kept saying 'Gyatt' instead of 'What.' So funny!"  
"My homie was trying to be cute and used 'Rizz' on me, but I just rolled my eyes like, 'Pog.'"  
"We’ve been in this 'Situationship' for two months now, and I’m over it."  
"That guy’s been spamming 'NPC' jokes nonstop—get a life!"  
"I can’t stop laughing at how they’re saying 'Babygirl' as a compliment now."  
"Did you see the viral 'Bussin' challenge? I’m still recovering from the aesthetics."  
"My crush keeps using 'Pressing' on me—I’m not a button, tho."  
"UWU is literally everywhere now—like, how many times do I have to remind you?"  
"I told my friend about the 'Glazing' trend and he called me basic for bringing it up."  
"The way they say 'Sigma' when someone’s acting extra? So relatable!"  
"This 'Delulu' energy is giving me secondhand embarrassment."  
"I’m pretty sure the person who invented 'Blorbo' needs help."  
"Why do kids keep saying 'Him/Her' instead of just using names?"  
"The 'Fanum Tax' memes are hilarious—but also confusing AF."  
"This 'Grindset' thing is honestly exhausting."  

Gyatt, man, I’m so gone for this new TikTok slang. Like, "Rizz" is such a vibe, but "Skibidi" sounds like something you’d say when you’re too high. Wait, "Sigma" though? That’s when someone’s got all the answers and you just gotta respect it. Oh, and "Fanum Tax"? I’m not even sure what that means, but it feels like it’s gonna be the next big thing. Anyway, back to this "Edge" thing—yeah, we’ve all been there when you’re cruising through life, and then you hit that edge where everything just clicks. Babygirl is so cute, though. Like, if I called my homie "Babygirl," she’d be rolling. But hey, it’s all good as long as we’re vibing. Speaking of vibes, "Bussin" is when the energy is just off the charts. You know that feeling when you’re in the zone? That’s "bussin." And don’t even get me started on "NPC"—like, are you seriously telling me I’m not an NPC? No way, my aura’s way too strong for that. Plus, I’ve got a glow-up planned this weekend, so I’ll be shining brighter than the sun. "Glazing" sounds like something you do with your eye contact—like staring so hard it glazes over. And yeah, "Lore" is when you’re spitting facts that no one’s ever heard before, but somehow everyone’s like, "Oh my god, where did you learn this?" You know what I mean? It’s lit. Him/Her vibes are always on point, right? Like, when your crush hits you with the Him energy, it’s just pure chaos in your brain. Blorbo sounds like something from the crypt—like a shadowy figure in the dark, probably with extra sauce. Situationships are the worst, though. You think it’s casual, but then feelings get involved, and everyone’s like, "Why is this so hard?" Delulu is when you’re just living your best life, no room for haters. Grindset is when you’re in that zone where everything’s clicking, and you’re unstoppable. Pressing is when you’ve got the facts, but you’re still waiting on that final push—like, "pressing send" on that text you’ve been staring at forever. Siren is when you hit that peak moment, and it feels like the whole world’s paying attention. Pookie is just pure adorableness, right? Like, when your pet does something too cute to handle. Mewing? Yeah, that’s straight up "cat person" energy, no doubt about it.
Alright, let's get this done! Here's some conversational text containing those TikTok slang words:

"OMG, that was such a Gyatt move! Did you see how she Rizzed the whole place? I’m dead, like, literally dead. Also, did anyone else notice howNPC that guy was acting? Just standing there, glazing everyone with his lore. And seriously, why does my brain keep saying 'Babygirl' when I try to sleep? It’s so frustrating! But hey, at least we can all agree that Grindset is real and we’re all in it together. Let’s mew about it later, yeah?"
I’m cringing because my ex tried to hit me with that "rizz" again, but honestly, I’m over it. Like, we’re both adults now, right? Anyway, my friend just sent me a TikTok where they’re doing these viral "glazing" challenges—so meta, but also kinda cool. Did you see how they’re layering glasses in reverse? 😜  

The other day, I was scrolling through and saw someone asking if "pookie" is a real term or just from that one viral video. And don’t even get me started on the "babygirl" trend—everyone’s doing it, but tbh, it’s so cute when they don’t realize how basic it looks.  

Oh, and I’ve been seeing "situation ship" being used everywhere—like, when you’re in that toxic relationship zone but still can’t let go. My friend’s been calling her ex "sigma" non-stop, which is just funny because she’s basically applying the same logic to everyone else now.  

This whole "lore" thing has taken over my feed too. Everyone’s sharing their own weird stories about why they love their sidekick or something. And don’t even get me started on how "uwu" is being overused—it’s so cringeworthy, but also kind of endearing in a cheesy way.  

I’m starting to think that this generation has officially lost its mind. But hey, at least we’re creating content that’ll be hilarious to look back on later. Right? 😅
Yo, did you see Gyatt last night? It was lit! Rizz was on point, literally couldn't look away. Skibidi'd that slope like it was nothing. Sigma energy is real, can't deny it. Fanum Tax for the win! Ohio or nah? Her edge was on point. Babygirl, hey, what's up? Bussin' moves, I respect it. He’s such an NPC, always quoting lore. This blorbo is giving major FOMO vibes. I’m in that situationship phase again. She’s out here delulu-ing about her favorite conspiracy. Grindset strong, yeah I’m all in. Pressing the button on this decision tonight. Oh, siren! Did you hear that? You’re the pookie to my widdle Bby. Mewwww, just trying to be cool.
sure fam lets go  
they were like "ohio" cause they were out here flexin'  
i was vibin' in my "babygirl" aesthetic when she pulled up  
we ended up at the "situationship" phase but i had to "delulu" and ghost  
she tried to "grindset" me but i was too busy mewing over the "glazing"  
the vibe was pure "pressing" levels but i couldn't handle it  
he kept saying "rizz" at every opportunity which was so cringe  
i had to explain why he wasn't a "sigma" just a basic bussin'  
we ended up at a 24-hour "lore" spot cause we were too lit  
they were talking about their "uwu" and i was just over it
"Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend? It’s all about Gyatt or Rizz, like, ‘Let me know if you want to grindset tonight.’ Babygirl, let’s go!"  

"Pressing for the bag, though. Don’t be a NPC and actually engage with content. Blorbo, someone said Glazing earlier—so cute."  

"Fanium Tax is real, like when you see people spending thousands on Skibidi or Ohio stuff. Situationships are lit, but Him/Her can be wild."  

"UWU sounds so soft, but don’t get too Pookie about it. Mewing over Lore is basic, though. Blorbo, I’m dead."  

"Glazing your profile pic to look extra, and then Delulu over a fanum Tax—cringe but relatable. NPC energy is low-key the worst."  

"Edge cases are when you ask for a Siren and they reply with ‘Pressing.’ Babygirl, stop being basic and get that grindset right."  

" Ohio is flexing hard right now, but don’t come at me with a Situationship unless it’s real. Pookie energy is everything."  

"Fanum Tax on full blast—Blorbo if you’re casual, or Him/Her if you’re the vibe. Lore can save lives, honestly."  

"NPCs are the worst, so Don’t be one. Babygirl, you know what I’m saying. Mewing over a Siren? Basic."  

"Pressing life’s buttons, or just straight-up Grindset. Gyatt or Rizz—let’s choose wisdom. Blorbo your way out of this convo."  

"Edge cases get me every time, like when someone drops a ‘Siren’ and you’re still trying to figure it out. Babygirl, let’s stop the mewing already."  

"Fanium Tax is real AF, like when you spend all your money on Ohio or Skibidi. Situationships are fake until proven otherwise."  

"NPC energy is low-key the most draining thing ever. Don’t be a Pookie and act cute after Delulu drops a fanum Tax."  

"Gyatt or Rizz? Both iconic. Babygirl, let’s make this grindset happen tonight. Oh, and don’t forget to Mew if you’re into that Siren."  

"Pressing for the bag, but also for the vibe. Don’t be basic and say ‘Let me know if you want to grindset’ without the Glazing first."  

"Blorbo your way out of this or Him/Her it. Lore is the answer to everything. NPC, get a profile pic already."  

"Fanum Tax is where the real money goes. Situationships are for casual vibes only. Don’t be basic and say ‘Let me know if you want to grindset' without the Glazing!"  

"Gyatt or Rizz? Let’s choose both. Babygirl, stop being a NPC and actually engage. Mew when they drop a Siren."  

"Pressing life’s buttons or just Grindset. Ohio is flexing hard—so cute. Blorbo your way out of this."  

"NPCs are the worst. Don’t be one. Pookie energy is everything. Delulu over a fanum Tax? Basic, but relatable."  

"Fanium Tax on full blast—Blorbo if you’re casual or Him/Her for the vibe. Lore can save your life."  

"Edge cases when someone drops a ‘Siren’ and you’re still trying to figure it out. Babygirl, let’s make this grindset happen tonight."  

"Gyatt or Rizz? Both iconic. Don’t be a NPC and say ‘Let me know if you want to grindset without the Glazing first."  

"Pressing for the bag, but also for the vibe. Ohio is flexing hard—so cute. Blorbo your way out of this or Him/Her it."  

"Fanium Tax is real AF. Situationships are fake until proven otherwise. Don’t be basic and drop ‘Let me know if you want to grindset' without Glazing."

This guy was just hitting me with pure Rizz and honestly, I couldn’t handle it.  
The vibe at the party was so lit, we were all on the same Grindset.  
I’m pretty sure my friend is in a Situationship right now, he’s been acting weird.  
Did you see that TikTok? It’s giving me major Babygirl energy.  
This new trend is so Fire, I can’t stop saying it’s lit af.  
Gyatt, bro, that was the ultimate flex.  
Skibidi season is here, and honestly, we’re all ready.  
NPC levels are real when your crush ignores you for a week.  
I’m over this relationship drama—give me a Pookie already.  
This group chat is lit af, can’t wait for the Glazing moment.  
My aesthetic is “Babygirl” vibes heavy, sorry if I’m extra.  
He’s been hitting me with Rizz nonstop, it’s sus.  
I’m 100% sure they’re in a Situationship again.  
The energy in this group chat is so Fire, let’s start the trend.  
Gyatt, this TikTok content is giving me life.  
This guy’s Instagram is pure Babygirl aesthetic, love it.  
NPC energy is real when you’re ignored for days.  
I’m sorry but I’ve been in a Situationship way too long.  
Pressing af, can’t believe this is happening.  
The way they’re shipping these characters is giving me Pookie feels.  
This trend is so Glazing, it’s giving me everything.  
My crush is hitting Rizz levels and honestly, I’m here for it.  
This group chat is on Fire, let’s go off.  


Dude, that move was so Gyatt, I couldn’t even."
She’s just being too extra with the Glazing."
I’m over this Situationship, it’s getting too lit."
Why is everyone always bringing up the NPC?"
That’s such a Babygirl move."
Let me get a sisko and chill later."
This is honestly giving me Rizz vibes all day."
I’m too tired for this Grindset, I swear."
Who even came up with the Blorbo?"
My friend just called me out for being a Delulu."
Pressing send on that TikTok was the best move."
This UWU energy is giving me life."
I’m not okay with this Pookie energy anymore."
Is this really a Fanum Tax situation?"
sh is acting like a Sigma right now."
Haha, I just saw this viral TikTok sound called "Gyatt" again. It’s so catchy! Did you hear it? Like, everyone’s been using it in their stories.  

OMG, my friend Rizzed me so hard earlier. He was like, "You’re the Sigma of the group," and I couldn’t help but laugh.  

I’m trying to get into this new trend called "Glazing." It’s where you add these weird sounds to your sentences, making everything sound cooler.  
U is basically the vibe today. Like, everyone’s so chill and using it in every sentence.  

I’m pretty sure my situmationship with my bae is on the edge of something big. I can feel it in my bones.  

Also, have you heard about "Delulu"? It’s like when you hyper-fixate on something tiny and make it the biggest deal ever. So relatable, right?  

My friend tried to explain "Pressing" to me. She was like, "It’s when you’re too into something and just can’t let go." I’m still trying to get it.  

I’ve been using "Babygirl" as a nickname for my squad, and they love it. It’s so fun and light-hearted!  

Pookie is another term that’s blowing up right now. You use it when someone’s acting a little extra, but in the cutest way possible.  

This whole "Grindset" thing is confusing me. It’s like being productive, but also stressed about it? I’m not sure how to keep up.  

And then there's "Blorbo," which I think is just another way of saying "idk." But it sounds cooler, so everyone uses it instead.  

It’s crazy how these slang terms pop up and take over so fast. I can’t wait to see what comes next!
, did you see that TikTok? Gyatt levels are through the roof!"  
"Ay, she’s so extra—she’s giving me Glazing vibes all day."  
"Situationships are lit right now, bro. I’m in one like, three layers deep."  
"His energy is outta bounds—pure Pookie mode."  
"UWU is the only response when the world gives you too much, yeah?"  
"She’s got that Sigma glow, I can’t even."  
"Fanum Tax has reached peak levels in my DMs, no cap."  
t plot twist had me like, 'Pressing hard, for real.'"  
"He’s pulling off a full-on Blorbo energy, honestly."  
"I’m 100% sure she’s on the Grindset, can’t deny it."  
"NPC is the ultimate flex when you’re just here to vibe."

Gyatt is when ur head spins so hard u can't even think straight. Rizz is like when someone makes a super smooth move that’s almost too much to handle. 
Skibidi is when u randomly say something out of nowhere that immediately becomes iconic. Sigma is when u just know someone’s about to let u down but they still do it anyway.

Fanum Tax is when ur crush charges u for everything in their presence, like emotional toll or something. Ohio is when ur brain just... stops working for no reason. 
Edge is when u’re so cool that even the people who hate u can’t help but respect u. Babygirl is when someone’s energy is just too much to handle, but you can’t help but love it.
Bussin is when u’ve had a really productive day but it feels like ur brain is about to explode from all the ideas. 
NPC is when someone acts like they’re in an anime and doesn’t notice how obvious they are. 
Glazing is when ur heart melts because of something so small, like a cute dog pic or a kinda nice Insta story. 
Lore is when u get stuck in this deep TikTok rabbit hole, trying to figure out who these people are and why their lives are so interesting. 
Him/Her is when u’re just too into someone’s content but they never notice you. Blorbo is when ur brain is just... gone, like you can’t even form a coherent thought. 
Situationship is when ur friend keeps telling you u’d be perfect for this person, but it’s just... not happening. 
Delulu is when ur love life becomes some kind of weird fan fiction that no one else gets. 
Grindset is when u’re so focused on school/ work that u can’t even enjoy your own life anymore. 
Pressing is when you’re like “I’ll text u later” and you literally mean it, but then u don’t, which is so pressing. 
Siren is when ur crush plays music right before they DM you, just to be extra.
Pookie is when someone’s so maxed out on being extra that they’ve reached puke-level energy.
 Mewing is when ur brain just says “meow” at the oddest times.
 
"Yo, did you see that Ohio video? So lit, right? Like, when they pulled up in that Grindset Whippet and just Rizzed everyone. 
I'm dying! Pookie, though, he was spitting facts. His Glazing game was on point. Did you catch the Blorbo moment? So random but so fire. 
NPC levels were high, though. She had the Lore down cold. And that Situationship? Pure gold. They're like, 'It's just us,' but I'm like, 'No, it's not.' 
That's straight Delulu energy. Plus, his Mewing was straight-up iconic. The Siren went off when he said that line about being 'just a Babygirl in a Big Boy pants.' 
So legit! And the Glazing? Yeah, that was pure Him/Her vibes. Like, he was buttering her up with that Charisma +1. It's wild. They're out here living their best lives, man. 
I'm honestly just here for the content. Like, why not? Enjoy it while it lasts."

"Gotta cop that Gyatt, it's lit af, honestly,"

"Did you see those viral videos? They’re giving me serious Blorbo vibes."  
"We’ve been in this Situationship for months now, and honestly, it’s lit."  
"My crush keeps hitting me with the Rizz hard—I’m not sure if I can handle it."  
"TikTok has changed my life. I’m officially a Babygirl at heart."  
"This season of *F* is giving me so many Glazing moments, can’t even."  
"I need to level up my TikTok game—this is the year of the Siren, or nah?"

"I’m not sure if I should be embarrassed or proud of my TikTok habits. Probably both."  
"This trend has me mewing so much harder than I expected—where’s the formula?"  
"Why is every comment just ‘Him’ or ‘Her’? Am I living in a simulation?"  
"TikTok’s algorithm is honestly too extra—I feel like a NPC sometimes."  
"I’m here for the Ohio summer vibes—nothing better than Grindset and Rizz."  
"My crush keeps hitting me with the Rizz, but I’m not sure if it’s real or just TikTok-level."  
"This is the best summer yet—no stress, all fun, and endless Blorbo energy."  
"I think I’ve reached peak Delulu. Like, my brain’s just…spiral."

"Gyatt, man, I just saw the most cringeworthy TikTok ever. How do people even watch that? But honestly, it’s kind of entertaining in a trainwreck sort of way. Rizz is everywhere these days, like everyone’s trying to be too cool. Skibidi for sure, though—those sound like made-up words but somehow they’re legit now.  

Oh my gosh, did you hear about the new TikTok trend where people just say 'NPC' and it implies their friends are background characters in their life? So relatable, right? And don’t even get me started on ‘Babygirl’ trends. It’s like adults are just living in a never-ending Gen Z phase.  

Texting my friend earlier, I said ‘Pressing,’ and she was like ‘What?’ and I had to explain it’s from that viral sound byte. Now everyone’s using it to be dramatic about their day. Honestly, it’s exhausting but also kind of funny how these sounds take over.  

The worst part is when people start glazing—like when they’re so into a trend for like two seconds before moving on to the next one. You can’t keep up with it, but you don’t want to miss out either. It’s all about staying ahead in the TikTok algorithm game, right?  

And don’t even get me started on ‘Him’ or ‘Her.’ It’s like everyone’s relationship status is now a viral sound effect. ‘Situationship’ is the worst because it’s not a real thing but somehow it’s expected to know what one is. Ugh, Gen Z life is so confusing yet so entertaining to watch."

My friend was like, "Hey, did you see that TikTok trend about Gyatt?" I was like, "Who even knows," but then we ended up watching hours of videos about Rizz and Skibidi challenges.  

We were at school and someone brought up Sigma for the fifth time, and honestly, it got so cringey but also kinda fun to watch. Fanum Tax was everywhere, like everyone had a new inside joke about it.  

The teacher tried to talk about Ohio, but no one could focus because we were all still recovering from the Gyatt viral video. Edge, like, became our go-to way of describing something super lit or flex-worthy.  

I caught my crush staring at me with those watery eyes and immediately thought they were glazing me. I wasn’t sure if it was love or just Glazing Mode activated.  

We spent hours maxxing out our snap stories, trying to get Chungus-level vibes. Situationships became the new normal, where we were all like, "UWU" in texts but never made it official.
Gyatt, why you always gotta be so extra?  
Rizz harder, bro, I'm feeling some type of way.  
Skibidi, are you even from around here?  
Sigma, you gotta chill out, it's just a meme.  
Fanum Tax, where did you get that money from?  
Ohio, you the one with the big mouth.  
Edge, do you always have to be so dramatic?  
Babygirl, stop playing with my feelings like that.  
Bussin, let's go somewhere quiet.  
NPC, why you acting so robotic?  
Glazing, you gotta slow down, it's not that serious.  
Lore, you always got the wildest stories.  
Maxxing, are you trying to flex right now?  
Chungus, where did you get that from?  
Situationship, this is getting too complicated.  
Delulu, why you always adding drama?  
Grindset, you gotta stop focusing so much on school.  
Pressing, calm down, it's just a game.  
High Key, you always gotta be the cool one.  
Pookie, stop with the cute vibes.  
Mewing, you gotta quit being so innocent.

"Why is my friend always saying 'Skibidi'? Like, does it mean something specific or nah?"

"My group chat is full of Sigma energy right now—everyone's trying to outdo each other with flexes."

"UWU is the best reaction for when someone’s being extra cute or soft. Just saying."

"My friends are out here 'maxxing' at the gym while I’m still figuring out how to use TikTok filters."

"OMG, did you hear about the 'situation'? It’s like a 'fanum tax' situation. Duh."


"Yo, did you ever see that TikTok about Gyatt? Like, when he just pops off randomly and everyone’s like ‘What was that?’ but no one really knows."  
"I’m such a Rizz. Like, I’ll just be minding my business, and then boom, I’ll say something super smooth and everyone’s like ‘How does he do that?"

I’m just trying to Rizz everyone but my brain is melting like a Glazing in the sun.  
My friend is so into this new TikTok trend where you say "Skibidi" and do some weird dance. I’m like, "Edge or not, I can't keep up!"  
This whole "Situationship" with my ex is giving me literal headaches. It’s like a "Delulu" situation but not in a good way.  
I was trying to be cool at the party but everyone was just saying "NPC" and I felt so out of place. What even is an NPC anymore?  
This is why I’m constantly maxxing, like, "Maxxing and Chilling." It’s the only way to keep up with these trends.  
My brain is honestly just grindi-seting 24/7 now. From "Babygirl" this to "Mewing" that, I’m losing my mind.  
I don’t even know what a "Pressing" is anymore. One minute it’s cool, the next minute it’s not.  
This whole "High Key" life is exhausting. It’s like, "Pookie" this or "UWU" that. I can’t keep up!  
I’m over this "Glazing" phase already. Give me a break, my brain can’t handle anymore meta references.  
I’m just here trying to "Rizz" the algorithm but honestly, it’s not working out.

"Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend? It’s all about Gyatt-ing your friends and making them say 'Oof' nonstop. My DMs were flooded with Rizz comments earlier, so I had to mute everyone to focus on my grueling homework. Skibidi is defs the vibe right now—everyone’s decked out in anime merch and quoting Lore like it’s their spirit animal. Sigma levels are through the roof at school, and I’m not even sure what a Fanum Tax is anymore. Just kidding, I still have an Ohio-shaped scar from when my mom caught me watching Chungus videos at 3 AM. Situationships are the worst—friends turning into strangers overnight because someone called them 'basic.' I’m out here trying to Maxx my summer breaks and Grindset till it hurts. If you see me mewing on TikTok, know that it’s not an excuse to come over. Just kidding again—I totally am. High Key or no high key, I’m living in this Glazing phase of my life."

"True. But hey, at least we’re living in the age of content, you know? Like, we’ve never had so much to consume."

"Exactly. And the slang is just getting wilder and wilder. I can’t keep up sometimes."

"Speaking of, have you heard about this new term everyone’s using? It’s like a mix between ‘rizz’ and ‘glazing.’"

"Wait, what even is that? Is it another TikTok meme or something?"

"Oh yeah, it’s all over the app. They’re saying it’s the next big thing in online slang."

"Alright, I’ll check it out later. But honestly, I’m just here for the memes. Nothing beats a good viral moment."

"Same! And don’t even get me started on the new TikTok sounds. Some of them are straight up vibe-checking in the clubs."

"For sure. But I’m still trying to figure out why some sounds are more popular than others. Like, what makes one sound go viral and another just fade into obscurity?"

"Who knows? It’s probably a mix of everything—the beat, the melody, how it feels when you hear it. Like, it has to resonate with people on a deep level."

"Yeah, that makes sense. And honestly, I’m here for it. As long as there are new sounds and new slang, the internet keeps getting more entertaining by the day."

"I was just trying to figure out if Gyatt is actually better than Rizz."  
"When you're in a situation with someone who's being too emotional about a 'situationship,' it can get pretty 'delulu.'"  
"It was cringey how my friend kept talking about their 'maxxing' and I couldn't help but feel like they were just an 'NPC.'"  
"Pressing for collab or nah?"  
"That video had so much Chungus energy, I couldn't stop watching."  
"My 'lore' is always on point, but this one took it to another level."  
"Gotta glue my 'glazing' when the squad's about to level up."

Delulu is when you take something cute and make it way too intense—like, “Why am I soobsessed with this one TikTok sound?”  
Grindset is the ultimate flex because it’s like, “I’m working hard, but in a cool way that doesn’t feel like work.”  
Pressing is when you’re so excited about something, you can’t even hold your phone still—it’s like, “OMG, did you see this tweet?”  
High Key is the vibe when you’re chill AF and don’t care about anyone’s opinions—but deep down, you’re just a little extra.  
Pookie is the ultimate term of endearment because it’s cute and sassy all at once—like “I’m not just your friend, I’m your pookie.”

Okay, let’s get into it! Here’s a chunk of natural, conversational text filled with brainrot slangs:

"Yo, did you see that TikTok video? So fire, literally, my brain just melted. The edits were so lit, I’m still vibing in the vibe zone, honestly. My fam is always on me about being too extra, but Rizz is real, you know? It’s not just about the moves; it’s the energy, the Glazing effect, the way you hit that Lore and make everyone else feel like they’re maxxing out without even trying."

"Skibidi season is here, and honestly, I’m so ready to level up my grindset. The stacks are stacking, and I’m feeling that Edge vibe hard. My squad’s all about it too—like, we’re out here mellowing in the glow-up, no cap. It’s lit AF."

"Did you hear about the new TikTok challenge? Oh, they called it the ‘High Key’ challenge. It’s all about shining so hard, even your DMs are lit AF. But Pookie mode is real, I’m not even lying. You have to go full-on mew in those videos to get that algorithmic love."

"UWU forever! The internet’s been taken over by the Chungus energy. Like, it’s everywhere you look—situationships, delulu moments, grindset vibes. I’m so here for it, honestly. It’s like a full-on Glazing of the soul."

"Fanum Tax is real, though. You can’t even go through TikTok without seeing those fan theories. It’s lit AF, but also kinda cringe when you think about how deep the NPC stuff gets. But hey, we’re all just vibing in our own vibe zones, right?"

"Pressing on FOMO is a real thing. You miss one trend, and your brainrot level drops by 50%. Like, where’s the High Key now? My timeline’s been shook ever since."

"My friend tried to explain Ohio to me, but honestly, it sounds too lit AF to even process. I’m just out here mellowing in my own maxxing zone, no cap. Brainrot is real."
Yo, did you see that TikTok trend where everyone’s saying "Gyatt" instead of "Like"? So funny but also kind of confusing. I was scrolling through TikTok and saw this video where the guy was just "Rizz"ing everyone—like he had some kind of magic or something. My friend keeps saying "NPC" when we're hanging out, but I'm not sure if it's just them being weird or if they actually think that way. Have you heard about the new TikTok challenge where people are "Maxxing" their lives? So wild!
I need to focus on generating a dataset of conversational chunks using modern TikTok slang. Here’s an example:

"Yo, did you see that Gyatt challenge? Everyone’s been doing it non-stop! I’m still trying to figure out the perfect way to execute it without looking like a complete moron. Rizz is so hard right now, though. Like, can’t nobody pull off the classic ‘I’m just here for the culture’ line anymore without it sounding cringe. Skibidi season is over, but I’ll never forget those early days when everyone was trying to be the next Sigma. Seriously, how does one just… maxx out like that? And don’t even get me started on the situationship drama! My friends are losing their minds over these Delulu-level vibes, while I’m just over here mewwwing about my grindset. High key energy, though, right? The fact that someone invented ‘pressing’ into a full blown TikTok dance is giving me life. I’m all for Pookie aesthetics, but can we please stop with the Mewing sounds in public? It’s getting too unprofessional. UWU"
Yo, let's dive into this brainrot slang session!  
"Did you catch that new TikTok trend? It was Gyatt level for sure!"  
Rizz is definitely an art form—like when you make someone feel like the smartest person ever.  
Skibidi challenges are all about those cringey sounds and awkward vibes.  
Sigma levels are high right now—I can't stop noticing it everywhere!  
Taxed AF on that new bag, though.  
Fly as in Flywalk? No, more like Fly in the sense of Flywear—so expensive.  
Ohio, man. I’m feeling so out of the loop.  
Edge is all over her outfit—so chic, so trendy!  
"Hey Babygirl, let's grab lunch!"  
That concert was Bussin’ on another level.  
He’s been acting like an NPC in our group chat—all nods and no real input.  
Glazing is the new trend—glitter everything, stat!  
That fan theory was pure Lore—so detailed, so convincing!  
Let’s Maxxing this weekend—I’ve got big plans.  
I Chungus’d my own living room with that surprise.  
We’re in a Situationship—casual, but always fun.  
She’s been Delulu lately, crying over everything.  
Grindset mode activated—no distractions!  
Pressing for snacks because I’m starving!  
She’s the High Key of the group—so stylish, so ahead.  
Why you Pookie me?!"  
"Get lost, it’s just Mewing over these cute cat memes!"
I’m totally vibing with my friend’s new TikTok account—she’s all about "Glazing" these viral videos. Have you seen her latest? It’s been "Maxxing" views nonstop! We’re trying to get our "Situationship" right, but honestly, it’s just so "Delulu" sometimes.  

I’m so over my math class—it’s all "Pressing" me already. But my dude is always saying I’m his "Babygirl," which is kinda sick. We’ve been crashing the "Skibidi" trend and it’s becoming a must-see.  

OMG, you have to check out this new challenge called "Chungus." It’s so "Grindset," but in the best way. My crush keeps sending me these "UWU" texts—like, seriously, it’s melting my brain.  

I’m always trying to "Rizz" my friends into watching these viral videos, but no one’s having it. Maybe I need to level up my "NPC" status. You know what I mean—being that person everyone just ignores because they’re too busy "Mewing."

"Hey my guy, did you see that new TikTok trend? It’s all about Gyatt and Rizz. I’m literally losing my mind over it."  

"I was just sitting there minding my own business when someone hit me with a Situationship. Like, where did that even come from?"  

"Yo, my friend tried to explain 'NPC' to me, and I was like, 'Is this some new slang or are you just really confused right now?'"  

"She’s been acting so extra lately. I’m not sure if it’s a Maxxing phase or she’s finally met her Pookie."  

"UWU is literally the only reaction I need for everything. Like, 'Oh no you didn’t!' – just UWU."  

"We’ve been in this grindset for months now, and honestly, I’m just here for the Glazing and the lore."  

"My roommate keeps saying 'pressing' every time I ask her to clean. I’m starting to think she’s secretly brainrotted too."  

"Someone told me about this new trend called 'delulu,' and honestly, I don’t know if it’s real or just people making up words."  

"I was maxxing out in the kitchen, and my sis came in like, 'What are you doing?' And I was like, 'This is not what it looks like.'"  

"NPC levels are basically my life right now. Like, how do they even expect me to keep up with everything?"  
"My friend’s been using 'bussin' nonstop. I’m pretty sure she’s about to start a TikTok account dedicated solely to it."  

"High key, right? Like, how does anyone even function without at least one 'high key' moment in their day?"  

"I’ve been trying to get my friend into 'chungus' mode, but she just keeps staring at me like I’m the NPC."  

"Tax is literally everywhere. Like, I can’t go a day without someone dropping it on me. What even is happening?"  

"Situationally, I’m just trying to exist and people keep hitting me with 'pressing' like it’s my vibe or something."
I was just Gyatt about that move.  
You gotta have some Rizz to pull that off.  
Skibidi in my area, though.  
I’m not here for Sigma vibes today.  
Fanum Tax on fleek status.  
Ohio, like, where is the line?  
Edge or bust?  
Babygirl, I’m literally a fan of everything.  
This grindset is killing me.  
Pressing send but my finger won’t stop.  
High Key energy, can’t handle it.  
Pookie, you’re too much.  
Mewing over that aesthetic.  
UWU forever.
