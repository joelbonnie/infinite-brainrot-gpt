That NPC at the party kept glazing over my fit like a total skibidi fanboy. Meanwhile my pookie tried to fanum tax my bussin fries but I was eepy from vamping all night. Ohio behavior fr.  

Sis brought up her situationship again—babygirl stay delulu thinking he’s got W rizz. He said luh cozy night in then hit her with the meh energy. Pressing for clout or nah.  

Skibidi toilet edits slay harder than sigma gym bros yelling gyatt during deadlifts. Rizzlers in the chat keep glazing my takes but I’m just here for the vibes.  

Tried to explain fanum tax to my math teacher. She called it Ohio calculus. My rizz? Delulu. Now I’m eepy from vamping till 3am watching skibidi compilations.  

Spotted a sigma reading Nietzsche at Starbucks. His W rizz had me gyatt-ing discreetly till my pookie dragged me out. NPCs in line were glazing his drip.  

Babygirl brought bussin cookies then hit us with the fanum tax mid-bite. Now she’s delulu claiming situationship with the barista. Ohio Friday nights smh.  

My luh meh mood vanished when my situationship sent a skibidi meme. Now I’m glazing his texts like a rizzler. Vamped my fit just to NPC at the park.  

Gen Alpha slang tier list: Gyatt (S-tier). Eepy (vamped to classics). Ohio (overused but slays). Delulu (bussin self-roast). NPCs stay pressing for sigma status.  

Overheard a sigma dissing skibidi humor. Bro’s W rizz is a glazing masterclass. Meanwhile I’m eepy from fanum-taxing my roommate’s ramen. Ohio vibes only.  

Pookie’s new situationship has NPC energy—zero rizz, all meh. Tried glazing her luh makeup look but she’s too delulu simping for sigma TikTokers.  

Vamped my nails metallic while debating if Ohio chili deserves the skibidi hype. My rizzler era begins when the fanum tax hits. Babygirl, pass the hot sauce.  

Mid-convo he dropped the gyatt Ohio meme. I cackled—total W rizz maneuver. Now my pookie’s glazing his sigma aura. Delulu hive stay winning.  

Eepy after fanum-taxing my sibling’s slay-worthy fries. Tried to sigma grind but ended up NPC-scrolling skibidi edits. Rizz? None. Vibes? Ohio-core.  

Glazing my luh plant collection when my situationship hit me with the skibidi sound. Now we’re eepy-vamping for a 2am W rizz Ohio road trip. Babygirl’s delulu agenda: activated.Bro tried to hit the Fanum Style in Skibidi Ohio and ended up paying the Fanum Tax twice. Womp womp, his rizz was bloat fr. Pookie got that gyatt on fleek, no cap. Slay, babygirl, slay! Ong, them fries are bussin but where the luh sauce at?  

Caught my mans glazing over that sigma NPC like he’s him. Bro’s on edge, babygirl, chill before you get hit with the bloat. Yo, that skibidi fan edit got me weak—why he edge so hard for a mid take? Womp womp moment.  

Erm… you call that rizz? Fanum tax came for bro’s whole vibe. Now he’s out here looking like a skibidi NPC. Still, gotta respect the grind—dude’s him when he’s not stuck in Ohio mode. Pass the luh glizzy, this babygirl’s starving.  

Sigma behavior unlocked: ignored the Fanum Tax, pulled up with unspoken rizz, and glazed his own haters. Ong, the gyatt on that bloat meme had me crying. Womp womp to the NPCs still stuck in 2023.  

Skibidi pasta challenge? Nah, bro’s out here doing the Fanum Style meal prep. Edging closer to cringe every day but slaying hard. Babygirl called him a NPC and now he’s on luh mode. L for glazing, W for sigma energy.  

Who let him cook? Tried to flex rizz but paid the Fanum Tax in front of gyatt nation. Now he’s Ohio-pilled, doing skibidi glazing for clout. Womp womp, take the L and log off, my guy.  

Pookie’s unhinged sigma arc went too far. Started edging haters, ended up a babygirl NPC. Still, that skibidi dance move? Bussin. Ong, Ohio really breeds the himbos. Fanum Tax collectors at the door, tho.  

Erm… this bloat take is giving NPC. RiZZless behavior, my guy. Hit the Fanum Style gym and come back when that gyatt’s slaying. Womp womp ain’t the vibe. Babygirl deserves better.  

Glazing over Ohio memes while ignoring the sigma grind? Luh bloat activities. Bro’s him when he’s not stuck in skibidi mode. Pass the bussin sauce, this Fanum Tax got me starving.  

Sigma protocol: evade Fanum Tax, rizz the gyatt, slay the skibidi haters. NPCs stay edging, babygirl stays fed. Ong, him energy is unmatched. Womp womp to the bloaters still stuck in the luh leagues.

Saw a sigma on my FYP flexing his drip while mewing in Ohio. Deadass thought it was a NPC until he pulled out the rizz and started spitting facts. Let him cook but low-key sus he’s glazing himself.  

Spill the tea: my blehh ex tried to slide into my sneaky link’s DMs with that skibidi gyat energy. Called them out and they ghosted—big yikes. Now I’m in my main character era, unbothered and slaying.  

POV: Fanum tax hits different when your baddie roommate takes the last Bussin’ snack. TFW you’re ready to clap back but she hits you with the ocky way smirk. Zero chill, fam.  

Stan Twitter is wild rn—some CEO of cringe posted a delulu edit of their fave and it’s giving cheugy. Comments are all cap like yaaas king but the vibe is mid AF.

NPC at the party kept glazing over the sigma’s fire rizz. Meanwhile, me and my QT sneaky link were spilling tea about his NPC energy. Whole thing was a certified W until someone mentioned Ohio—mood ruined.  

My toxic trait? Thinking every viral hit CEO of rizz wants me. Sis said stop glazing and touch grass, but I’m delulu hundo P. Praying the algorithm blesses my glow up.  

Fanum tax level: stealing your bestie’s Gucci eyeliner because hers is on fleek. She caught me and now I’m canceled—spill the tea or keep it tight? Choices.  

That skibidi trend is straight bussin but low-key mid if you’re not a sigma. Saw a boomer try it on my FYP and almost died. Comments were like dank cringe, let him cook tho.  

Ghosted by my situationship but found their Finsta full of thirst traps. TFW you’re jelly but your friends scream waste—time to glow up and find a king who’s hundo P based.  

Edge lord in my DMs trying to rizz me up with NPC-tier lines. Hit him with the blehh and blocked. Big yikes energy, zero drip. Stan a queen who knows her worth.  

Spilled tea about my ex’s flop era and now their crew’s clapping back. IDGAF—my vibe’s snatched, and I’m living for the drama. Canceled? More like finally free.  

Sis said my OOTD is giving cheugy but I’m like nah, it’s Y2K fire. Posted it anyway—let the stans debate. Either way, FYP gonna eat it up. Main character energy, periodt.  

Mood: Listening to a viral hit while low-key shipping my two oomfs. Their tension? Spicier than a sneaky link’s texts. Someone spill the tea before I manifest a situationship.  

TFW you’re trying to mew in peace but your sibling bursts in yelling skibidi Ohio. Can’t even. Ghosted their vibe and threw shade via Finsta. Zero regrets—it’s a W for mental health.

I was just vibe checking my friends and realized they were all lowkey flexing without even knowing it.

She’s been spilling the tea about everyone in our group chat, but honestly, no cap, she keeps it real.  

He’s got such big energy that you can’t help but feel lit every time he walks in the room. 

I was trying to vibe shift during the Zoom meeting, but my boss caught on and said, 'Keep it professional.'  

After leveling up in the app, I’m finally able to plug in some trends and make moves.

They say I’m extra, but honestly, if you don’t know, you’re just not unbothered enough.  

I was flexing my skills at the Renegade challenge, and tbh, I got it going viral.

The mood was on fleek, and we all knew it was going to be a legend night.

She’s been sponging all the hot takes in our group chat, but she’s also got some facts to drop.

I told them I’d plug it in during the next meeting, and now they’re all asking for more.

No cap, this was one of those moments where you just had to say 'for sure' to keep the energy up.  

His ‘big energy’ is unmatched—lit af, always ready to spill the tea.

I’m trying to vibe check these trends, but honestly, I’m still figuring out what’s for sure going viral.

She’s unbothered AF and always got level up content to share.

The group chat was lit when we started fact-checking each other’s claims—no cap, it was hilarious.

The vibe was lit because the aesthetic was on fleek and everyone was spilling the tea about the mood over Miami.  

I felt FOMO when coomer culture started taking over, but then I realized it was just the plot twist nobody saw coming.  

Wholesome energy was everywhere, and the icon of the group had a vibe check that left everyone unbothered.  

Sounds only on TikTok played a major role in my feels, making me question if I was missing something or if it was just a mood over Miami situation.  

Goals were being thrown left and right, but I knew I had to keep up with the aesthetic or get left behind.  

Aura was thick, and I could feel the energy shifting as people started spilling the tea about what really happened behind closed doors.  

The vibes were checked constantly, and if you weren’t unbothered, you know the coomer vibes would come for you.  

I was flexing my wholesome card hard, but deep down, I knew I was just living rent-free in my own brainrot.

Walking past the gyatt parked at the gas station, my sneaky link texted saying keep it lowkey but bring that zaza. I told him NPC behavior fr but still slid through after mewing in the mirror to boost my sigma rizz.  

Fanum tax hit hard when Jake tried snatching my glizzy at the cookout. Everyone yelled L move bro while I secured the W by hiding the bussin mac and cheese.  

Her lore’s wild—went from delulu over a situationship to full baddie mode after vamping her style. Now she’s ice cold, dropping iykyk hints about her sigma grindset.  

TikTok’s skibidi edits got me bogged. Comments like slay or Ohio but fr tho that Ewokie filter’s bala. My oomfie said it’s giving big chungus energy and I can’t unsee it.  

Tried the gyatt workout trend—10/10 regret. Couldn’t even rizz up my gym crush ’cause I was too busy glazing over her edge. She side-eyed me like yikes L take.  

Drip too icy? More like grimy. Forgot my sneaky link’s scenarioship rules and showed up reeking of zaza. He said ewokie vibes and ghosted. Now I’m NPC-coding my texts to revive the rizz.  

Sigma tip: skip babygirl-ing your ex. Hit the skibidi shuffle, tax Fanum’s fries, and let the gyatt-maxi-primal-grindset-lore do the work. Glizzy gladiators stay winning.

Bro tried to hit on her at the party but his rizz was glitching when she mentioned Fanum Tax—dude got so pressed he started glazing her Sigma tendencies like an NPC. Meanwhile my pookie over here dropping skibidi lore like Ohio is the new edge capital.  

That delulu siren from math class keeps yelling gyatt every time someone bussin a move near the vending machine. Babygirl thinks she’s him but honestly the situationship energy is balah levels of cringe.  

Spotted a blorbo at the café today wearing a sigma grindset shirt while whispering skibidi rizz to his phone. Tried to Fanum Tax his fries but he hit me with the Ohio stare—full glazing no cap.  

Why’s my sibling pressing about my lore like they’re NPCs stuck in a siren side quest? I’m just here for the bussin memes and the occasional him/her debate. Stay delulu pookie.  

Her skibidi impression went full gyatt mode during the Zoom call and now HR’s edge lore includes a chapter on why Fanum Tax applies to office snacks. Babygirl out here rizzing the corporate glazers.  

Dude brought a balah to the gym screaming sigma rizz while doing curls. The locker room lore now says Ohio siren vibes got him pressing weights like NPCs in a glazing simulator.  

Pookie’s new situationship is peak delulu—they quoted skibidi ballads over tacos then tried to Fanum Tax my last chip. Called them out and they hit the him/her pose like a sigma avoiding edge duty.  

Caught my blorbo glazing their reflection whispering sigma affirmations. Tossed a skibidi remix their way and now they’re pressing me about Ohio-tier rizz. Fanum Tax this energy please.
