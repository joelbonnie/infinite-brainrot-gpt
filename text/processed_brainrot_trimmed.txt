The fanum tax on this pizza is mad real.  
Youre basically an NPC sometimes, honestly.  
Lets talk about the viral baddie trend. Its basically the modern version of complimenting someone in public, right? And while were at it, whats with babygirl being thrown around so casually? Its cute but also a bit confusing. Have you heard glizzy becoming the new term for something sleek or cool? Im still figuring out its exact meaning. Oh, and ewokieis that just Star Wars fan speak now? Or is it something entirely different? Anyway, lets move on to delulu. If I had a dollar for every time Ive heard that word in the last month itd be enough for a new phone. And what about chungus? Is it the new dick move or just another slang term Im not in on? Honestly, Im starting to think were all just making up language as we go along.  
Did you catch the TikTok challenge where people are saying slay nonstop for  hours? Its exhausting but also kind of funny. And what about boggedis that the new way to say busy or is it something more specific? Im still not sure. But hey, if we cant agree on a single slang term, maybe we should just accept that were all speaking our own language now. Lets talk about grumpy cat being called chungus. Is that the official term for grumpy cats or is it just a meme inside certain communities? And while were at it, whats with mewing becoming a thing? Is that the new way to refer to cat noises or something else entirely? Honestly, Im starting to think these slang terms are less about communication and more about tribe signaling.  
Lets get back to sigma. Is it still cool to use that term or has it become overused? Im seeing it everywhere now, but Im not sure if thats a good thing. And what about balais that the new term for Bali or just another slang word? I think its just another slang term, but Im not entirely sure how its used. Anyway, lets talk about edgeit seems like the new term for being on the verge of something, whether its a trend or a relationship. And what about bussin? Is that the new way to say busy or is it something more specific? Im not entirely sure, but Ive heard it used in both contexts.  
Have you noticed how  NPC is being used to describe people who dont interact much online? Its kind of funny but also a bit sad. And what about fanum tax? Is that the new term for tolls or something else entirely? Im not sure, but it sounds like a madeup word. Anyway, lets move on to lolita being called babygirl. Is that the official term now or just another slang term? I think its becoming more of a joke term rather than something taken seriously. And what about rizz? It seems like its still popular, but Im not sure if its been replaced by anything else.  
Lets talk about glizzyis that the new way to describe something sleek or just another slang term? Im seeing it used in both contexts, so its a bit confusing. And what about grimy? Is that the new term for being in a bad mood or something else? Ive heard it used both ways, which makes it a bit tricky to pin down. Anyway, lets get back to slay. Is it still the goto term for impressive content or has it been replaced by something else? It seems like its still popular, but Im not sure how long thatll last.  
Did you hear about TikTok influencers using baddie as their tag and then selling merchandise with it? Thats wild. And what about zaza? Is that the new term for a cute or quirky behavior or something else? Ive heard it used in both ways, so its a bit confusing. Anyway, lets talk about edge. Is that the new term for being on the verge of something big, like a viral trend or a relationship? It seems like it is, but Im not sure how long thatll be around.  
Lets get back to rizz. Is it still the ultimate way to compliment someone online or has it lost its charm? I think its becoming more of a joke now, especially in certain communities. And what about bussin? Is that the new term for being busy or something else? Ive heard it used both ways, which makes it a bit hard to take seriously. Anyway, lets move on to chungus. Is that still the goto term for grumpy cats or is it becoming more of a meme within specific groups?  
Have you noticed how babygirl is being thrown around so casually now? It seems like its becoming more of a joke term rather than something taken seriously. And what about mewing? Is that the new way to refer to cat noises or just another slang term? Im not sure, but it sounds like its becoming part of internet culture now. Anyway, lets talk about slay. Is it still the ultimate term for impressive content or has it been replaced by something else? It seems like its still popular, but Im not sure how long thatll be.  
Lets get back to grumpy cat being called chungus. Is that the official term now or just a meme inside certain communities? I think its becoming more of a meme rather than something taken seriously. And what about mewing? Is that the new way to describe cat noises or just another slang term? It seems like its becoming part of internet culture, but Im not entirely sure how its used outside of that.  
Okay, so after all this, I think weve established that these slang terms are being used in a variety of ways. Some seem to be becoming more popular and others are being overused, while some might just be inside jokes or memes within specific communities. Its clear that language is evolving, and these slang terms are part of that evolution. But honestly, its a bit overwhelming to keep track of all of them and how theyre used.  
I guess the main takeaway here is that slang is always changing, and whats cool now might not be cool later. Plus, its probably impossible to know every single slang term and how theyre used across different communities. So, maybe its best to just enjoy the ride and embrace the fact that language is constantly evolving.  
So, in conclusion, while Ive tried to wrap my head around these new slang terms and understand how theyre being used, its clear that theyre part of a larger cultural shift where language is becoming more dynamic and inclusive. It might be overwhelming at times, but its also exciting to see how people are finding new ways to express themselves.

Gyatt, seriously? That was pure gold!  
Youre like a sigma queen, running the show.  
Cant believe she pulled up with that straightup flex.  
NPC levels, though? So extra and so on point.  
This energy is just too much, but in a good way.  
Situationship goals, right? Like, lowstress but high vibe.  
Iykyk, honestly, thats iconic for the books.  
Sigma grindset for sure, always on top of their game.
Sure! Here are some natural chunks of text containing the provided slang words
Yo, did you see that Gyatt in the group chat? He was spitting facts!  
Im so over this situationship. Its like a relationship but not really.  
Bro, youre living in a Sim worldNPC level vibes tho.  
Hey Babygirl, lets grab some Skibidi and chill later.  
My vibe is currently on pressing mode, cant stop thinking about it.  
Dude, that move was so rizz, Im still feeling it.  
Were basically a power couple, no? Like Sigma levels.  
Shes got the Glazing energy, cant compete with that.  
True, but HimHer is the vibe for the night.  
Everyones acting like they invented Blorbosmdh.  
Falling into this grindset again, ugh.  
Tax seasons here, but Im still in Delulu mode about that project.  
Yo, we gotta get our Edge back, this is getting too basic.  
Shes got the Mewing sounds on pointso relatable.  
UWU, its so cute when they dont know whats hit them.  
Let me know if you need more!
Gyatt man, did you see that video? So Rizz was in it, right? Like, he was just sitting there with his Blorbo energy, flipping through the Skibidi. I was like, Oh my God, hes such a Sigma! But then she pulled out a Fanum Tax and we all lost our minds.  
Hey, did you hear about that Situationship? It started when someone tried to Grindset too hard and ended up in the NPC zone. Thats basically when your friends stop caring because theyre too busy mewing over their own Lore.  
I was just thinking about how we all were into Glazing last summer, right? Like, everyone was doing it, and then suddenly it was replaced by Babygirl energy. Now its like, Oh, Im in my Blorbo phase! but honestly, were all just Deluluing about it.  
You know when youre trying to talk to your crush but end up being a Pookie? Like, you just wanna Siren them or something, but then you get too nervous and end up with UWU in your texts instead of something cool. Thats basically how I ended up in this Situationship nightmare.  
Oh, and dont even get me started on when everyone was screaming LORE!!! because they found out their ex was into some obscure niche fandom. We were all just sitting there like, We knew this was going to happen, because were all basically walking Glazing machines.

Yo, did you see that viral Skibidi challenge? It was lit AF, right? Like, everyone was doing it, and the sound effect was so grating but in a good way, you know? I could feel my brain rotting from just listening to it for five minutes.  
OMG, this new TikTok trend is out of control. People are losing their minds over itliterally, like theyre acting irrational or something. Im starting to think were all just one step away from fullblown brainrot.  
And dont even get me started on the Babygirl trend. I swear, if I hear that sound effect one more time, I might just lose my mind. Its like they designed it specifically to drive us all insane.  
Wait, did you hear about the Situationship trend? Yeah, its where people document their fake relationships for clout or something. Honestly, its so confusing and yet so relatable that I cant stop watching. But also, its making me question my own relationships, which is not cool.  
And Pookie? Ugh, thats been the goto slang word for months now. Like, everyones using it in every sentence. Its so overplayed, but somehow its still catchy. I dont know how to feel about it anymore.  
Oh, and the Glazing trendwhat is even happening there? Its like people are just standing around glazing, which honestly sounds like something youd do in a lab. But they make it look so cool and edgy.  
Im starting to think that Gen Z is just trying to outdo each other with more absurd slang every day. And honestly, Im here for it because its providing endless content for TikTok comedy.  
But also, its kind of scary how quickly these trends take over. One minute its Gyatt, the next its Rizz, and now its Pookie. Its like a neverending cycle of brainrotting slang.  
I wonder if well ever go back to simpler times or if this is just the new normal. I guess well have to endure it together, right?
Yo, thats such a Rizz move, honestly. Like, Gyatt up, Skibidi vibes. BTW, did you hear about the Sigma level flexing? No way, thats straightup Delulu energy right there. Im feeling this Grindset though, for real. The lore is so strong in this situationstraightup HimHer levels. Blorbo, tho? Like, cant even handle it. And the Situationships? So lit AF, man. But the Glazing is on full display. Puke, get a grip. Oh my God, the Babygirl energy is so strong Im losing it. And the NPC level? Like, who even knows anymore. But the Edge is real as everstraightup Mewing for days. Whats up with the Pressing? Its too much, honestly. But then again, no cap, its all about the UWU vibes. No Cap!
Hey, did you see that TikTok where they tried to pull off a Gyatt but obviously failed? So cringeworthy yet somehow relatable. Im dying over how they thought that would work.  
Wanna Rizz the person who keeps posting photos of their Skibidi in the group chat? Like, we all know its just them flexting their imaginary fame.  
Bro, dont even get me started on the new Sigma trend. Everyones acting like they invented being extra, but Im here for itextra points for style, at least!  
UWU is literally the only acceptable reaction to most of this stuff, right? Like, if youre not using UWU, are you even Gen Z?  
The Glazing trend has officially reached peak level. Im over it, but also cant stop watching the videos.  
FANUM TAX FOR SURE. Like, why else would people be so extra about their Situationships status? Its all just performance art at this point.  
And dont even get me started on how everyones scrambling to use Pressing now that its been overused. Irony much?  
WAIT, the Babygirl trend is back? But honestly, Im here for it because Ive always been a Babygirl in my own quiet, yearold way.  
NPC levels are off the charts right now. Like, cant we just accept that some people are naturally boring? Or is that not allowed?  
This whole Delulu thing has reached peak confusion. Who even knows whats true anymore?  
Gotta respect the Grindset thoughwhen your job is so unbothered its basically a Grindset in action.  
Pressing over everything? Like, if youre not pressing for something specific, arent you just wasting your time?  
Pookie is honestly the only acceptable term for anyone whos ever had a dog. Fact.  
Mewing for hours over a viral videoyes, yes, Im living my best Mewing life.  
Bro, the way people are using Blorbo now? Its like they found the ultimate flex and never looked back.
Alright, lets get into it. Heres a dataset full of modern TikTok slang and conversational phrases
Yo, did you see Gyatt in math class today? He was spitting facts!  
Im so over this situmship. Its been three weeks, and I dont even know where we stand.  
Shes such a NPC, just standing there like a lost puppy.  
Hes got the Rizz, man. One look at him and youre melted like butter in the sun.  
Im in my Ohio period right now, all about those big, baggy clothes and no care in the world.  
Shes out here glazing everyone with her soft, boppy energyso relatable!  
Why are we even still in this grindset? Like, wheres the fun in it?  
Im shipping him so hard right now, like hes my one and only Pookie.  
Shes been on that babygirl vibe all week, and Im here for itso precious!  
Cant believe theyre still in this delulu phase, acting like everythings a crisis.

This is giving me pressing vibes for sure. Like, when you cant stop thinking about it.  
Shes been mewing about her UWU moments nonstopbut Im here for it!  
And there you have itauthentic, casual conversations filled with TikTok slang!
Mew, did you see Bro go full Gyatt earlier? He was spitting facts about Rizz and how its lit AF. I swear, that kid could start a trend with his Glazing skills. Oh, and dont get me started on Ohio vibestheyre just too much sometimes. Maybe he should chill with the Blorbo and focus on his Situationship. Ugh, so relatable, right?

Grindset is so strong right now. Pressing too hard, Im here for it. Sirens calling, gotta answer. Pookie, youre the cutest, honestly. Mewing all day every day, no regrets. UWU forever!
Gotta love how Gyatt took over TikTok overnight! Wasnt expecting that!
Rizz is the ultimate flex, but also so cringe when its forced.
Skibidi season is here, and honestly, its everything!
My Sigma levels are high right now, cant stop thinking about it!
Fanum Tax is real, like when your friend hits you up for cash.
Edge moments are the best, but also the most unpredictable.
Babygirl energy is on point, but sometimes its just too much.
Bussin through TikTok trends, gotta keep up or get left behind!
NPC energy is when youre just going with the flow.
Glazing all day, gotta make sure youre in on the grind!
Sure! Heres a sample of natural, conversational text containing the provided slang terms
Yo, did you see that new TikTok? The person kept saying Gyatt instead of What. So funny!  
My homie was trying to be cute and used Rizz on me, but I just rolled my eyes like, Pog.  
Weve been in this Situationship for two months now, and Im over it.  
That guys been spamming NPC jokes nonstopget a life!  
I cant stop laughing at how theyre saying Babygirl as a compliment now.  
Did you see the viral Bussin challenge? Im still recovering from the aesthetics.  
My crush keeps using Pressing on meIm not a button, tho.  
UWU is literally everywhere nowlike, how many times do I have to remind you?  
I told my friend about the Glazing trend and he called me basic for bringing it up.  
The way they say Sigma when someones acting extra? So relatable!  
This Delulu energy is giving me secondhand embarrassment.  
Im pretty sure the person who invented Blorbo needs help.  
Why do kids keep saying HimHer instead of just using names?  
The Fanum Tax memes are hilariousbut also confusing AF.  
This Grindset thing is honestly exhausting.  
Gyatt, man, Im so gone for this new TikTok slang. Like, Rizz is such a vibe, but Skibidi sounds like something youd say when youre too high. Wait, Sigma though? Thats when someones got all the answers and you just gotta respect it. Oh, and Fanum Tax? Im not even sure what that means, but it feels like its gonna be the next big thing. Anyway, back to this Edge thingyeah, weve all been there when youre cruising through life, and then you hit that edge where everything just clicks. Babygirl is so cute, though. Like, if I called my homie Babygirl, shed be rolling. But hey, its all good as long as were vibing. Speaking of vibes, Bussin is when the energy is just off the charts. You know that feeling when youre in the zone? Thats bussin. And dont even get me started on NPClike, are you seriously telling me Im not an NPC? No way, my auras way too strong for that. Plus, Ive got a glowup planned this weekend, so Ill be shining brighter than the sun. Glazing sounds like something you do with your eye contactlike staring so hard it glazes over. And yeah, Lore is when youre spitting facts that no ones ever heard before, but somehow everyones like, Oh my god, where did you learn this? You know what I mean? Its lit. HimHer vibes are always on point, right? Like, when your crush hits you with the Him energy, its just pure chaos in your brain. Blorbo sounds like something from the cryptlike a shadowy figure in the dark, probably with extra sauce. Situationships are the worst, though. You think its casual, but then feelings get involved, and everyones like, Why is this so hard? Delulu is when youre just living your best life, no room for haters. Grindset is when youre in that zone where everythings clicking, and youre unstoppable. Pressing is when youve got the facts, but youre still waiting on that final pushlike, pressing send on that text youve been staring at forever. Siren is when you hit that peak moment, and it feels like the whole worlds paying attention. Pookie is just pure adorableness, right? Like, when your pet does something too cute to handle. Mewing? Yeah, thats straight up cat person energy, no doubt about it.
Alright, lets get this done! Heres some conversational text containing those TikTok slang words
OMG, that was such a Gyatt move! Did you see how she Rizzed the whole place? Im dead, like, literally dead. Also, did anyone else notice howNPC that guy was acting? Just standing there, glazing everyone with his lore. And seriously, why does my brain keep saying Babygirl when I try to sleep? Its so frustrating! But hey, at least we can all agree that Grindset is real and were all in it together. Lets mew about it later, yeah?
Im cringing because my ex tried to hit me with that rizz again, but honestly, Im over it. Like, were both adults now, right? Anyway, my friend just sent me a TikTok where theyre doing these viral glazing challengesso meta, but also kinda cool. Did you see how theyre layering glasses in reverse?
The other day, I was scrolling through and saw someone asking if pookie is a real term or just from that one viral video. And dont even get me started on the babygirl trendeveryones doing it, but tbh, its so cute when they dont realize how basic it looks.  
Oh, and Ive been seeing situation ship being used everywherelike, when youre in that toxic relationship zone but still cant let go. My friends been calling her ex sigma nonstop, which is just funny because shes basically applying the same logic to everyone else now.  
This whole lore thing has taken over my feed too. Everyones sharing their own weird stories about why they love their sidekick or something. And dont even get me started on how uwu is being overusedits so cringeworthy, but also kind of endearing in a cheesy way.

The worst part is when people start glazinglike when theyre so into a trend for like two seconds before moving on to the next one. You cant keep up with it, but you dont want to miss out either. Its all about staying ahead in the TikTok algorithm game, right?  
And dont even get me started on Him or Her. Its like everyones relationship status is now a viral sound effect. Situationship is the worst because its not a real thing but somehow its expected to know what one is. Ugh, Gen Z life is so confusing yet so entertaining to watch.

My DMs were flooded with Rizz comments earlier, so I had to mute everyone to focus on my grueling homework. Skibidi is defs the vibe right noweveryones decked out in anime merch and quoting Lore like its their spirit animal. Sigma levels are through the roof at school, and Im not even sure what a Fanum Tax is anymore. Just kidding, I still have an Ohioshaped scar from when my mom caught me watching Chungus videos at  AM. Situationships are the worstfriends turning into strangers overnight because someone called them basic. Im out here trying to Maxx my summer breaks and Grindset till it hurts.

Rizz is so hard right now, though. Like, cant nobody pull off the classic Im just here for the culture line anymore without it sounding cringe. Skibidi season is over, but Ill never forget those early days when everyone was trying to be the next Sigma. Seriously, how does one just maxx out like that? And dont even get me started on the situationship drama! My friends are losing their minds over these Delululevel vibes, while Im just over here mewwwing about my grindset. High key energy, though, right? The fact that someone invented pressing into a full blown TikTok dance is giving me life.

Shes always talking about her sigma, which Im still trying to figure out. This group chat is lit AF  were all just spamming fanum tax to keep the conversation alive. That new TikTok meme is so Chungus, you cant even handle it. Im trying to maxxing my Insta  but my followers arent buying it. Hes been pressuring everyone about that viral video  so extra. Shes always saying shes in her babygirl phase  which Im still processing. I cant believe hes using glazing to describe his new car  too much, though.
OMG, did you see that my guy Rizz pulled up with the drip last night? Straight up flexing, no cap.  
I was sitting there minding my own business when someone asked me about my Situationship and I was like, Whew, thats deep.  
My friend kept saying Glazing every time we talked about the new TikTok trend, but honestly, I had no idea what they were talking about.  
That one girl in class is straightup Delulu, always quoting Naruto and acting like shes Naruto herself.  
My squad was out chillin, and someone brought up the term Chungus in a completely random context, and we all lost it.  
I tried to explain Maxxing to my parents, but they were like, What are you even talking about?  
I told my crush I was in a Situationship, and she looked at me like I had two heads.  
My dude brought up the Grindset when we were talking about school, and honestly, it made zero sense coming from him.  
That TikTok video about Babygirl making pancakes had me in tears, no lie.  
I was midtext to my friend about a new viral sound when I realized I was pressing too hard.  
My cousin is always using NPC to describe people who dont interact at parties, and honestly, its kinda spot on.  
I couldnt stop laughing when someone referred to their ex as a Pookie, like they were talking about a pet or something.  
The way my friend keeps saying Edge when he talks about girls is both hot and confusing.  
My aunt tried to explain TikTok slang to me, but I was too busy trying to figure out if shes a Brainrot herself.  
Ive been using Glazing in every sentence lately, and my family is starting to think Im fullon lost.
Bro, did you see that new TikTok trend where everyones doing the skibidi? Its so extra but in the best way possible.  
Oh my gosh, Im all about it! Like, when they say gyatt, it just hits different.  
For sure. And have you noticed how people are always talking about their situation these days? Like, were all just living our best delulu life.  
Hah, so true. But honestly, sometimes its overwhelming how much glazing is happening in my DMs.  
I know, right? And dont even get me started on the lore thats been floating around. Its like, were all trying to be the next chungus.  
Exactly! And if someone calls you a sigma, just know its a complimentthey see your dominance.  
Oh, and when someones being extra pressing, its kinda cute but also kinda annoying because Im trying to keep my grindset going.  
Hah, same! And dont forget about the babygirl commentstheyre just code for adorableness.  
For sure. Its like everyones walking around with their own bussin energy.  
I know! And when someone says youve got a high key, it means youre just living your best life, no cap.

Hah, lets make it happen!  
Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend? Gyatt is literally everywhere, and honestly, its kind of lit.  
Gotta love when your friend rizzes so hard, you just cant help but laugh, no matter how cringe it is.  
My dude was spitting facts about Skibidi being the ultimate flex, and I was like, yeah, were all leveling up here.  
Sigma energy is real, though. You know when youve got that confidence thats just unbotherable?  
Why even bother with a situationship when you can just maxx out and make it official already?  
UWU is the ultimate flex because who doesnt love being soft and cute AF?  
Pressing too hard on TikTok is basically asking for a , so better make sure your content is fire.  
My girls been glazing nonstop, and honestly, its giving major FNF vibes.  
High key energy is the only way to survive these algorithms. Low key is just begging to get ghosted.  
You cant tell me that Rizz isnt a fulltime job, like how else would you keep up with all the levels?  
Babygirl energy is everything, but also, when do we finally admit that its just as addicting as Candy Crush?  
Bussin harder than a PowerPoint presentation at work. No flexes here, just pure content grind.  
NPC level When your friend asks you to watch their TikTok and youre just sitting there like, Whats happening?  
Delulu energy is the only way to explain why Im still watching these second clips that shouldve been canceled two weeks ago.

My dude just went off with a straightup Sigma moment, told someone straight up no.
Im trying to figure out if I should use Pressing or Grindset for my next TikTok.
Did you hear the new slang? Its all about Babygirl and Mewing now.
This group chat is lit, everyones been slanging Glazing and Lore nonstop.
My friend just called me out with, Youre really flexing your Sigma.
I was trying to use Maxxing, but my friend said I had to level up with Delulu.
This TikTok sound is iconicits a mix of Situation and Fanum Tax. So classic.
Im literally so confused why my friend is acting like an NPC sometimes. Like, they just mirror everything I say and dont have their own thoughts.  
Did you hear about the viral TikTok where someone tried to explain Ohio and it was pure chaos?  
Edge or no? My crush gave me a side eye that was straight up glazing.  
Im in this situationship where neither of us wants to make it official, but were both still hoping for more.  
My brother is out here deluluing about how Chungus is the new viral meme and Im just sitting here like, Alright, Ive seen it all.  
I was scrolling through TikTok and saw someone maxxing out in the commentsliterally, they were unbothered AF.  
This group chat is so lit right now, were talking about everything from grinds to pressing deadlines.
Yo, did you see that new TikTok challenge? Its so lit, like fully Gyatt energy. And that one person kept saying Ohio every time they mentioned their locationso wild. Im basically living in a Skibidi world right now, no cap.
Gotta love when your crush starts using Rizz levels straight up in the DMs. Like, Hey, youre my Sigma, and I know it. And dont even get me started on the Glazing energy of my friendspeople are losing their minds over it.
Maxxing is basically a sport now. My group chat is all about itHow high key is this?! Weve been memes deep for days. And lets not forget the lore behind that viral videochefs made it happen, straight up.
The grindset is real. Im so over it sometimes, but then you see someone do something legendary and youre like, Im Chungus if I dont appreciate this. Situationships are the worst, thougheveryones in one but no one wants to admit it.
Delulu levels are through the roof these days. Like, when your friend says, This is my pookie moment, and youre just there vibing. And dont even get me started on how many times Ive heard mew in a dayUWU.
Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend where people are saying Gyatt instead of Got it? So random but totally lit. Im like, why not just say got it already? But yeah, the vowel sounds are fire. Anyway, my friend was like, Im so rizzin right now, and I was like, dude, youre killing me. What even happened to ratchet? Its all about Sigma now. Like, Sigma or not, Im out. And everyones talking about their Situationships being lit AF. Ugh, its so annoying but also kind of cool how were creating our own language. Oh, and NPC is the ultimate flex for when someones acting extra. You know what I mean? Like, Im not an NPC, Im a fullfledged human. And dont even get me started on Glazingits like when your vibe is so strong, people just know youre out there glazing the scene. Honestly, Gen Z is just out here making up words left and right, and its so refreshing.
Gyatt got me thinking about how Rizz is just a flex, like literally, why do we even say it anymore? Skibidi season is over, but Sigma always stays. Fanum Tax is when youre too extra in group chat, and no one wants to pay attention. Ohio is when your crush ignores you for a week and you just chill, cause youre too cool to care. Edge is when you see someone else flexing harder than you, and you still manage to look cooler. Babygirl is the ultimate flex, like you didnt even try, it just happened. Bussin is when youre lowkey mad but still hiding it. NPC is when youre in a group chat and your contribution is crickets. Glazing is when someone elses luck is straight up cursed. Lore is when you make up the dumbest stories to impress your friends. Maxxing is when youre too lit, like youre the sun. Chungus is when youve been hit with one too many bad decisions but still somehow pull through. Situationship is when youre not really in a relationship but pretending to be for some weird reason. Delulu is when you convince yourself youre in love with someone whos clearly not into it. Grindset is when youre trying to study but your brain is just done. Pressing too hard for no reason, High Key is when youre unbothered AF, Pookie is the cutest form of affection ever, and Mewing is when you purr so hard its literally impossible to ignore.
Im totally Rizz right now, like, I cant stop thinking about him.  
Did you see those Skibidi snacks? Theyre lit AF.  
Shes been so extra with the Babygirl energy lately.  
My crush is vibechecking me hard with the Glazing moves.  
Weve been friends for years, but sometimes it feels like a Situationship.  
Hes majorly Delulu about his favorite TikTok creator.  
Im trying to get into this Grindset and level up my content.  
Pressing send on that text was one of the hardest decisions ever.  
This High Key flex is giving me major FOMO.  
My friends are always saying Im too Pookie, but I dont care!  
Shes got the cutest Mewing expressionsjust melt my heart.  
I cant stop staring at these Chungus memes on TikTok.  
Its a toxic relationship but also somehow addicting AF.  
This Lore is so wildI cant even handle it.  
My aesthetic is very Maxxing right now, you feel me?  
We need to collab on this EP and make some viral bop.  
NPC level flexing is real, and Im here for it.
I was scrolling through TikTok and saw the new Viral Video That One Dude Who Just Gyattd His Entire Feed. People were Rizzin at his Style, but I was more like, Okay, who let Ohio into our vocabulary again? My friend texted me saying she spotted someone doing the Chungus in the hallwayturns out it was just a kid wearing weird socks. Meanwhile, my DMs are blowing up with people trying to FANUM TAX me for some random challenge I did last week. Shes been maxxing out her Insta with glowup vids, but Im just here trying to not get caught in any Situationship drama. Have you seen the new TikTok trend where people are just sitting there like, LORE because they cant think of anything else? Its so cringeworthy yet relatable. Oh, and my dude is always talking about his Grindset, which Im pretty sure is a combination of grandstanding and just being basic. Skibidi is just another word that no one understands, but somehow its become a thing to say when youre confused. And Glazing... yeah, I dont even know what thats about. Maybe its a new trend where people are just sitting around staring into the camera like theyre in a daze? Doesnt make much sense, but thats TikTok for you.
Yo, that energy was straight up High Key, like you know what Im saying?  
She had me feeling so Rizz, man, it was lit.  
We were vibing Skibidi hard, just chilling and having fun.  
Hes such a Sigma, always got the moves like that.  
We gotchu, my Guy Trippin out on that Glazing vibe.  
Literally, she had me Maxxing the whole night, no cap.  
That was some nextlevel Chungus energy, honestly.  
Im so over this Situationship, its not even funny.  
Why you always be Deluluing like that?  
My aesthetic is just vibe checks and Grindset, yknow?  
That was such a Pressing moment, I cant even lie.  
Im honestly living for these Pookie aesthetics lately.  
Mewing over that cute little fluff is just basic.  
Youre always on that NPC energy, honestly.  
Im so done with this toxic relationship vibe, no.  
Why you always bringing the Rizz to every convo?  
That was straightup Babygirl energy, for real.  
Im not here for your High Key life, nope.  
Youre out here Grindsetting like a pro, my guy.  
Shes honestly got that Glazing glow, cant even lie.  
This Situationship is giving me vibes from every angle.  
Im not over the Maxxing energy, sorry, whats that?  
Why you always be so extra with the Pookie aesthetics?  
NPC levels are out of control, no cap.  
Yo, did you see how she Rizzed everyone at the party last night? Like, seriously, where do they even get off thinking they can just come up with these moves?
Im so over this whole situation. Like, why Gyatt are we not just vibing in the DMs instead of talking about it IRL?
You know when someone just glazes over you because theyre too busy flexing their Maxxing levels? Yeah, thats always so awkward.
Why is everyone acting like this is a situationship and not just a regular relationship with boundaries?
Im literally so into this Grindset right now. Like, how else are we supposed to keep up with the fastpaced world of TikTok trends? 
Thats basic. You need to stop being in your Delulu state and level up your Flex.  
The way he just Chungusd the whole grouplike, what even happened there?  
Im not over this. Like, Edge or not, you cant ignore the facts.  
Why is everyone always bringing up their Babygirl status? Like, were all adults here!  
Thats not a real friendship. Thats just pressingly loyal to the point of being a NPC.  
Im not here for this. Like, Glazing over something so minor is just basic AF.  
You cant sit here and act like you dont Maxxing at least once a day.  
This isnt a phase. This is the Lore, alright?
Alright, heres a natural and creative way to incorporate some of those words into conversational phrases
Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend? Its all about being High Key and flexing your Edge. You gotta be Rizz though to pull it off.  
My friend is so into Maxxing, shes always saying Glazing when shes hyped about something. Im not even sure what it means half the time, but she loves it!  
Im trying to figure out if I should use Chungus or NPC when talking to my crush. I dont want to come off as too basic.  
The new slang is all about being Babygirl. Like, saying Pressing when youre stressed and Mewing when youre into something cute. Its so extra, but I love it!  
You gotta be careful with Sigma though. People think its cool, but you might end up sounding like a snob.  
My group chat is always lit with Bussin, Wet, and Pookie. Were all about being unbothered and living our best lives.  
Im so over Fanum Tax right now. Its everywhere, but no one actually knows what it means anymore.  
If youre not Delulu, youre missing out on the vibe. Its all about being passionate and a bit dramatic.  
The new trend is to use Lore when explaining something super random. Like, I saw a rat the size of a cat in my kitchen yesterdaystraightup Lore.  
You gotta use Ohio when youre trying to sound cool but not too tryhard. Its casual and relatable.  
My friends and I are all into SituationShip, where youre kinda dating but not really together. Its complicated, but so lit.  
If someone Mews at you, its the ultimate flex. You gotta know how to respond with a Pookie or else.  
Weve been calling each other NPC lately because we feel like extras in someone elses life story.  
You cant not know what Skibidi means if youre into TikTok. Its everywhere, and its so fire!  
Im all about being Gyatt, but only when Im feeling extra. You gotta keep it vibes on point.  
Pressing is the new lit. If youre not pressing, youre just living in D.  
The vibe is always Glazing when the squads together. Its that smooth, unstoppable energy.
Yo, did you see Gyatt drop that lit move? He was Rizzing the whole time.  
Shes been on that Sigma vibe latelycant even look at her without getting lost in the energy.  
Im over it, like, Why is Ohio so extra right now? My friends are losing their minds over it!  
That was straightup Skibidi energy, no cap. Everyone was flexing their inner Ohio in the group chat.  
He just pulled up with that fanum tax energy, and I was like, Who even wants to date right now?  
They were definitely trying to get spicy with the situation ship in TikTok comments last nighthigh key, though!  
Im so glad I maxxed out my grindset this week. No cap, its been lit.  
Pookie energy was strong on Saturday nights everyone was chasing that pressing vibe hard.  
My girl was out here mewing all day about her delulu level were not okay!  
Can you believe he just went full babygirl in the DMs? So extra, but so lit.  
Did you see how he pulled up with Gyatt energy but then Rizzed everyone? 
That move was so extra, it had all the elements of a Fanum Tax situation. Im tryna level up my TikTok with some Chungus contentlike, 
wheres that Glazing aesthetic though? My head is basically spinning like a PC fan right now, were living in a Situationship, man. 
I told you, this is pure Delulu energy. Cant believe shes still Maxxing me like this. The grindset is real, but the Grindset is stronger. 
Pressing send on that High Key flex? No cap, Pookie. Mewing over UWU is basic, but its cute in a way. Ohio is lit AF, right? 
Edge or no edge, Babygirl. If you aint bussin, youre just not bussin. NPC energy is everywhere, like Lore to these kids. 
Glazing everything up with that Sigma vibe.
Bestie was serving cunt in that sigma male rizz TikTok live while mewing like Leonardo DiCaprio walking through Ohio after a cancelled hot girl walk. When the comments started glazing Kai Cenats gyatt, she spilled the tea with a deadass grimace shake reactionno cap, its giving NPC energy but make it delulu.  
The CEO of skibidi toilet lore tried to gaslight the chat about fanum tax, but everyone just yelled L ratio touch grass. Someone dropped a bussin copypasta about main character energy, and now the whole fyp is doing Oppenheimer style edits with big dick energy and glazing like theyre eepy after guccitier ghosting drama.  
Pookie kept stanning the gen alpha skibidi rizzler meme, lowkey sending me with how they ate that glazing session. Stan said slay period pooh but highkey got the ick when the vibe switched to sigma male lobotomycore. Yikes, thats not itdo it for the plot frfr.  
No cap, the sigma rizz Olympic finals will feature Kai Cenats gyatt vs. the grimace shake CEO in a glazing competition judged by Leonardo DiCaprio walking NPCs. If you spill the tea on fanum tax lore, youll unlock NPCtier big yikes clout. Sir, this is Ohioiykyk.
Im so FOMO about this new TikTok trend, but I cant even figure out whats going on with these ice people. Did you hear about that whole Situationship situation? Its basically like a relationship but not really one. Snatched! And dont get me started on Rizzthis guy at school has it on lock. Hes got the vamp energy for days, and his lobotomylevel selfawareness is giving me life. Plus, did you see those glizzy memes? Pure gold.
Hey, did you see that Ohio trend? Its so lit, right?  
Spill, spill! Whats going on with this new TikTok challenge everyones obsessed with?  
Skibidi, Im dying over these moves. How do they even keep up?  
L, like, why is my phone blowing up with notifications about this new dance? Its insane!  
Vibin all day, vibes are just everything. You feel me?  
Ghosted again? Ugh, why cant I get a vibe on this?  
Drip, drip, driphow do they manage to look so cool all the time?
Im so sick of people asking me for stuff, like pick me all the time.

Sometimes I just gotta be like, W, this is too much.
skibidi bois are out here trying to flex their aesthetic but honestly, its just extra. Like, weve all seen those cringey TikTok videos where people mew over a cute cat or gyatt in the comments. Its all hits different until you realize how basic it actually is. Im over it tbh. Do it for the plot, thoughtheres no way youre not going to include that one viral sound that we all have on repeat. Bogged AF.

Yo, did you see Pookie post the other day? He was straight up vibing in the kitchen with that Grindset energy. Im so boggled by how much they can turn a regular moment into content. Cap, just cap. Like, why do they always have to make everything into a flex? Its wild.
Can you believe how sneaky link those TikTok challenges are? Youre scrolling through your For You Page, and boom, theres another one popping off. Im already boggled by how much content we consume daily. And dont even get me started on the GOAT memes  theyre just iconic.
Calling it, Im  sure the GOAT is coffee. Without it, life would be so Grindset. Honestly, Id mew about that all day long. But no one wants to see a Pookielike flex from me, right? Just give me my latte and lets move on.
Sometimes Im just like, Why is everything so bogged down with drama? Like, cant we just enjoy a cap moment without it turning into a fullon meltdown? Grindset much, huh?
Ive been trying to figure out why TikTok users are always talking about sneaky links. Its like theyre on a neverending scavenger hunt for the next viral video. And when they finally find one, they mew about it nonstop until everyones sick of it. But hey, thats just how it goes with Pookie energy.
Man, Im so bogged by the amount of stuff I need to do. Between work and my sidehobby of Grindseting, I feel like theres no cap in sight. And dont get me started on the GOAT projects Ive been juggling  its all Pookielike stress but somehow manage to keep pushing through.
Did you know that cap has become the goto response for anything and everything? Like, That was lit  cap. Im so over this  cap. Even Cant wait for the weekend  cap. And its not just about agreeing its becoming a fullon flex of your personality. But hey, thats just how it is with brainrot.
Sometimes I feel like everyones living in their own Grindset bubble. Were all so bogged by our own stuff that we dont even notice the GOAT moments happening right in front of us. And when someone tries to share a sneaky link, you know its about to get real Pookielike with the mewing and the constant tagging until everyones over it.
Life was going pretty smoothly until I stumbled upon a sneaky link that turned everything into a Grindset. Now Im boggled by how one video can change your entire mood. And why does it always feel like theres a GOAT at the end of every viral trend? Just when you think youre out, they pull you back in with their Pookielike charm.
Honestly, sometimes I just want to scream, Cap this! because it feels like everything is bogged down by unnecessary drama. And while Im at it, lets also declare the GOAT once and for all. No more Pookie energy  give me a break!

Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend? Its so grimy how theyre all vibing in those viral videos. Im literally sus about it, though. Like, why is everyone acting so extra? Big yikes, man, this could be another ratio situation. I bet the ratio of people watching versus actually having content will be wild. Glizzy up, or what?
Girl, stop being so sus about everything. Youre basically mewing too hard. Lighten up, okay? The drip is real, though. If youre vibing with the right crowd, youll get it. But dont come crying to me when your ratios all over the place. Big yikes, Im not even sure why youre so sus about this.
Man, that was such a big yikes move. Why would they do that? Sus much? No wonder everyonesratio is going crazy. You thought it was a glizzy situation, but nah, its just another grimy trend. Drip off, maybe? Or are you vibing in your own little corner now?
Ugh, Im so over this. The mewing is real, but its honestly sus. Like, can we stop already? Why does everything have to be so extra? The drip was good while it lasted, but now its just vibes and ratio obsessed. Big yikes, this generation is wild.
Yo, Im vibing on this new app, but the grimy content is heavy. Sus much, right? Like, why is everyone so quick to mew about it? 
The drip was fire, but now its all ratio talk. This is getting too extra for me, honestly.
Hey, did you see that new TikTok trend? Its all about saying sirmaam to your fads.
So casual, right? Like, Bro, can you spare some cash for gas?
My friend is on a sigma kick lately, always quoting that one video about selfimprovement.
Not sure if its ice or just basic behavior. Anyway, I was like, That move was so cold, giving me major ice vibes but also some sigma energy. 
We should probably do something wild, you know? Like a lobotomy to escape this noise. Lets skibidi and make this weekend the most legendary.
Did you see that Situation in my DMs? It was lit. Im just vibin, you know? Like, not stressing about the grind because Im in my grindset. Oh, and she said something about touch grass, which was so relatable. We ended up at this random spot with snacks and just chilled. Shes got that pressing energy though, always on the go. You gotta keep up with the chungus vibes or youre out. Im just here for the plot, like, do you even have a life outside TikTok? Thats all I can think about these days.
glazing over the past weekend was litmy friends and I were vibing hard, had some Rizz, and totally gatekept the competition.  
brb, gonna go Grindset on some lore about the new TikTok feature everyones losing their minds over.  
Oh my god, I just saw this viral  Ohio challengeits so meta, I cant even handle it!  
I was scrolling through and saw someone dropping pure facts with  Fanum Taxtoo iconic.  
gnm, nvm, lets not get into the lore of this new app everyones obsessed with.  
You know when youre just chilling, minding your own business, but then someone drops a  gyatt and youre immediately in on it?  
Im over here trying to keep up with the Rizz levelsbut honestly, its too much for my brain.  
Someone better gatekeep this trend before it dies out like all the others.  
The Grindset is real when youre just trying to enjoy your coffee and someone hits you with a glazing meme.  
Im not here for the drama, but the lore is so wildI cant stop thinking about it.

Hey, did you hear about my friend trying to pull off the grimace shake at the party last night? She had us all laughing so hard!  
Im pretty sure my mom doesnt understand TikTok slang shes still using NPC levels of engagement.  
My bet is that I can do more viral trends than you this weekwhat do you think?  
That guy in the coffee shop was giving me serious oppenheimer style vibes with his intense staring.

Im starting to think Im the sigma of my friend groupeveryone follows my lead but I dont even try.  
Thats not a real thing, right? Like, how can you have an ice personality?  
My cousin is taking the whole delulu approach to everything these days its both hilarious and exhausting.

i was like oomfie when i saw that new aesthetic edits, they were just so grimy and on point. honestly, let him cook with the best edits out there. ugh, this oppenheimer style vibe is just too much, but in the best way possible. im literally mewing over these looks, no cap.
my friend was asking about kai cenat the other day, but i was like, were not talking about that. grimy energy is real, tho. ugh, i need to let him cook with the new trends. this oppenheimer style stuff is just too lit, cant even handle it.
im so over this trend already, but you know, let him cook because the new stuff is fire. oomfie energy is everywhere, and honestly, its exhausting. but also, its kinda grimy in the best way.
big yikes that move was so extra, Fanum Tax on point for the win, sus I didnt see that coming, main character energy for the gram today, L lets go already, let her cook and serve that energy, Edge or go home, leonardo dicaprio walking into a room with his charisma.
Yo, that new TikTok trend is lowkey wild but I cant help but vibe with it. My friends are all fanum tax over it, like theyre obsessionlevel dedicated. I swear my roommate tried to Delulu me the other day, acting all dramatic about something minor. The whole thing just gave me major main character energy, you know? Weve been calling each other sneaky link because were always tagteaming to expose the next viral moment. Honestly, its both cringeworthy and addicting at the same time. Gen Alpha is out here redefining the culture one TikTok soundrack at a time.
Man, after yesterdays drama, I was so boggled I couldnt even focus on my skibidi. My friend kept talking about Gen Alpha trends, and I was like, NPC energy, for sure! Then she mentioned something about cooking and I was like, Let him cook? Like, literally? We ended up FaceTiming her dog and it was all high key flexing.
Yo, did you see that Sigma flex at the party last night? He had us all clowning!  
OMG, this glizzy challenge is litIm dead.  
My homie got the ick when he tried to do that viral TikTok. So funny!  
W, wheres the bala at? Im starving!  
Sigma energy is real. You either have it or you dont.  
Clowning in your DMs with these trends is just iconic.  
The W was strong on this new songhe had the whole squad groanin.  
Bussin out for snacksliterally, no cap!
Text Dataset for Brainrot Slang  
Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend? Like, its so lit I cant even handle it. 
My friends were like, ewokie about it, and I was just moshing to the hits different vibe. 
Also, the Glazing effect is out of control rn. You gotta NPC these big brands tho, theyre trying too hard. 
And Gyatt, man, Gyatt is everywhere. The worlds gone full Lore, honestly.
Youre just an NPC in my life right now.  
Im gatekeeping the secrets to the universe.  
That move was so grimy, I couldnt even.  
Maxxing out my Instagram with these edits.  
Let them cook, and let the drama begin.
Sigma u already kno, like literally, u shouldve been on that vibes from day one.
Stop with the babygirl stuff, frfr, its getting too cringe.
Gucci flexing hard, no cap, Im spitting facts.
Vibes are everything, man, youre lucky to have any.
Why u so salty? Lighten up, frfr.
Rizz levels are high right now, dont even try to play me.
Fanum Tax the only tax worth paying.
Man, that was such a rizz move yesterday.  
The main character energy in this group chat is so strong!  
Im extra tired, like I dont even know what day it is anymore.  
Did you see how they just hit the ick and left the situation?  
This situationship is giving me so much main character energy right now.  
Why are we always defaulting to do it for the plot when things get too dramatic?  
Shes bringing such extra levels in this group chat, no cap.  
Did you see that new TikTok trend? Its all about spill in the comments. Everyones ghosted by their exes but still trying to rizz someone new.
Ugh, my best friend is always using terms like not them and chungus. I cant keep up with their main character energy.
Ive been scrolling through TikTok all day, and every video has the term POV. Its so annoying but also kind of catchy. Im starting to use it too.
Someone in my group chat just said, Im not here for this, which immediately made me think of not them energy. So relatable.
Ive been trying to figure out why everyone is obsessed with fire. Maybe its because it sounds so positive and lit?
Did you hear the new TikTok sound thats all about rizz? Its basically a whole new way to flex your personality, or something.
My feed has been blowing up with POV trends. Im starting to think its the new replacement for viral.
I cant get enough of these Gen Z slang terms like spill. Its like theyre rewiring our brains to speak a whole new language. 
Every time I see someone tagged in a TikTok, I half expect them to respond with, not them, but its actually kind of funny how its becoming its own trend.
Ive been ghosted so many times, and honestly, Im over it. But then again, maybe theyre just following the main character energy and moving on. 
Someone once called me a chungus in a joke, and now I cant stop thinking about how funny it is. Its like the ultimate flex of selfdeprecation.
Ive been trying to use TikTok slang like a pro, but Im still not here for the spill. It feels too forced sometimes. 
This whole Gen Z slang thing is either genius or brainrot, and Im starting to think it might be a little of both. 
POV videos are everywhere now. Ive even started making my own just to fit in with the crowd. 
I cant stop rereading this text about spill. Its like its stuck in my brain now. Is that normal? 
Rizz is the new way to compliment someone without sounding too cheesy. Its clever, Ill give them that.
Main character energy is the vibe were all trying to channel, right? Or at least thats what TikTok makes us think. 
Ghosted isnt just for breakups anymore. Its become a term for any kind of letdown in life. Thanks, Gen Z.
Not them is the ultimate flex because it doesnt even need an explanation. Just two words and youre out. 
Chungus might be the most chaotic slang yet. Its like the wild west of internet culture.
Hey, did you see that video? It was so gaslighting how people cant believe Im still L about that one time.
 Iykyk, yeah, its wild. But honestly, Ive been ghosted by literally everyone in my friend grouplike, ghosted is the new sirmaam. 
 I feel like Im in a simulation or something. The vibes are just not there anymore.
  And dont even get me started on the whole fanum tax situationsome people still owe me that favor. But yeah, lifes a vibe, right? Or at least it should be.
OMG, did you see that TikTok trend? Its so GOAT.
I cant believe people are still trying to get clout its all about FOMO now.
That new slang is sus you gotta keep up or get left behind.
Lets bet on who can do more challenges firstGOAT wins!
Her outfit was on fleek, but she had some sus moves though.
Hey, did you see how she snatched that bag?  
No cap, that was lit AF.  
Yeah, but the situ is so messy right now.  
Do it for the plot, tho, someone gotta make it interesting.  
Yo, my pookie is mad extra.  
Pressing too hard, cant even chill.

 Oh my gosh, I ratiod my own post when I saw the likes werent adding up fast enough.  
 Ive been hit with  ick too many timescant we just agree to disagree without the drama?  
 The NPC energy is real when your friend is acting like a bot after seeing their favorite TikTokmer gets M followers overnight.  
 When someone uses  fanum tax as an excuse to not split the billits wild how they expect us to keep up with their slang but not basic math.
Yo, chill, touch grass and die, why you acting like a NPC? Let him cook while youre at it, and dont forget to add some salt to the beefing.  
Im deadass serious, Chungus energy is everything, but also, dont forget about the plot, okay?

 This is lit, the skibidi energy is so strong right now.
 Im trying to figure out if I should gatekeep or just let it all out.
 The main character moment was when they pulled up with no prior warning, deadass.
 High Key stuff only, no cap.
 I was in my own POV until the friend spilled the tea about their lobotomy.
 You know when youre just glazing over because FOMO is real.
 Were all trying to be the next big glazing influencer, but lets face it, well never reach that level.
 His deadass personality is unmatchedhe doesnt care about aesthetics or anything.
 I could vibe with this High Key aesthetic all day long.

Stan culture is real, but sometimes its just too much. Slay or die, thats my motto. Shes literally bringing the situationship energy to the next level. 
Im so over this big yikes, for sure. Chill, its just some opa style content. Stan isnt just a name its a lifestyle. 
Babygirl energy is the only thing keeping me alive right now. Ohio has some extra, but Im not sure if its worth the hype. 
You cant tell me oppenheimer style isnt iconic. Stan is the ultimate flex, honestly. Slay or die, and I mean that literally.

 Salting over something minor is just plain bitter. Keep it frfr, please.
 My group chat was lit last night, everyone was bussin over this new trend.
 The POF Point of Frustration was real when the WiFi cut out during a bussin moment.
 Hey, did you see that new TikTok trend? Its so frfr.

 I was like, pick me challenge or nah? and now Im just confused.
 UWU, I cant handle how good this TikTok is. Kai cenat, for real.
 Im not trying to be basic Im just here to enjoy my zaza moment.
 Why is everyone obsessed with delulu these days? Its just funny sounds!
 I told my friend a lore last night, and now theyre still quoting it.

This was one of those moments where I had to say iykyk, literally.
Ive been Sigma all day, just vibein to the beats and stuff. Did you see that skibidi toilet?  Im deadass trying to find my glizzy.  
Yo, hits different when youre spilling over the top of the trends like Gyatt. No cap, its lit AF.  
Sigma gotchu on the mukbang, but the lore is real deep. Like, where did that drop even come from?  
Gotta be deadass if you think glizzy isnt iconic right now. Its straight up vibe energy.  
Im over here just spillin facts about the latest leakHits Different for sure!  
Yo, did you see that video? She rizzed so hard, I couldnt stop laughing. Lets find out where she got those vamp kicks fromgatekeeping all day, huh? Anyway, we should probs meet up later and slay these wings.  
That guy in class is such a weirdo. Hes always talking about touching grass instead of focusing on his studies. Like, pick me, Im already too tired to deal with this.
OMG, my ex texted me again. Hes been ghosting me for months but now wants to touch grass? Whatever, Im over it. Pick me at literally nothing.  
Someone in my group chat is asking if we can gatekeep the next study session. Ugh, seriously? Cant believe how extra people are being right now.
Slay, slay, slay! Thats all anyones saying these days. But honestly, Im just here for the perioooodt energy. Its giving me life.  
Did you see that TikTok trend where they say touch grass every time someones being extra? So cringy yet so relatable.  
My friend is always trying to rizz everyone. Like, one more time, huh? I get it, but keep the vampy lines to a minimum, please.
Let me tell you, Im  sus for sure.  
I was  extra with my outfit yesterday.  
That meme made me  spill coffee everywhere.  
Oh my gosh, that person is  vamp AF.  
Why is it always me being  sus in these situations?  
The energy at the party was  on God.  
Im literally  stan for that new artist.  
Dont even play with me, Im  ewokie level crazy.  
Got more? Lets go!
Yo, did you see how she lit up when he asked her out? For sure, she was on fleek with that response.  
This vibe is so strong, I can feel it in the room.  
Im spilling the tea later, but for now, just know Im keeping it real.  
Youre ghosting me, or you honestly not?  
The energy between us is unmatched.  
Lets flex on these haterstheyre nowhere near my level.
Hey, did you see that new TikTok trend where people are calling themselves babygirl in a super cute but cringe way? Im already sus about it.  
My roommate keeps saying let her cook, but I think theyre just trying to get out of doing the dishes.  
I cant stop laughing at these viral mewing videoslike, where did Gen Z even get the time to be this extra?  
That NPC energy is so strong right now, Im honestly scared for their mental health.  
Ugh, my friend keeps using say sike rn in every text, and its honestly making me dumber just reading them.  
My cousin is fully embracing being a clowning dad and its both hilarious and awkward to watch.  
Some people are calling themselves Sigma now because they think theyre too good for relationships. Sus?
Sure! Heres a creative dataset of natural, conversational phrases using TikTok slang
 Im highkey ready for the weekend vibes.
 Let me just lowkey check my DMs againso lit.
 Did you see that new TikTok trend? Its giving me life.
 This snack is so fire, its maxxing out my cravings.
 My friends are always giving me the best GOAT moments.
 Im lowkey over here trying to unplug for a bit.
 That drama was giving me a fullon lobotomy.
 Cant believe how the internet is just chefs kiss sometimes.
 Let him cook and let the creativity flowno cap.
 Sometimes my brain just hits maxxing modeliteral.
Hey, did you see Lore got clowned last night? Like, literally everyone was Wing about his moves, but he still ended up slayin those TikToks. Be so fr, cant even handle it.
Im literally so over this drama. Like, cap, its been too much for my brain. But hey, maybe if I just chill and be extra, Ill be the next big influencer. Tea on that later tho.
The skibidi was wild at the concert! Everyone was losing their minds, and Im not lying about it. Be so fr when you see those moves. Clowning isnt even an adjective for how crazy it was.
sure heres some natural conversational text containing those words  
Im just here for the sneaky links and the ohio vibes, honestly.  
She was slayin and had the cap on point, no doubt about it.  
perioooodt is lit, but ive seen better edits from eepy slops.  
fanum tax is so extra, but you know im here for it.  
youre telling me shes giving its giving energy? cap that.  
ohio never fails to bring the eepy vibes into the room.  
shes been slayin with her sneaky link aesthetic, tbh.  
the perioooodt and cap combo is everything, honestly.  
faneum tax or not, im all about those eepy edits.
Yo, this whole TikTok obsession is just on God level, like how everyones so edge about it.  
Stay salty, my friend, but dont forget to keep it cute as a chungus whenever.  
Im too lowkey to be anything but a girlboss in my little corner of the internet.  
Skibidi toilet? Yeah, thats definitely the vibe when youre just chilling with your squad.  
Ugh, this is so ick, I cant even.  
Why are people always so fr about their aesthetics?
yo i was just lowkey flexing my new merch and my homie was like you got some extra style  but honestly the way peopleHigh Key these days is wild af. Im literally trying to figure out if Chungus is a real word or if its just gen z messing with us. Like, did our parents even have a term for lore? Probably not. Anyway, I could be wrong but my friend told me that grimace shake was the official TikTok slang for something idk what lmaoo. But yeah, extra is everywhere now, like you cant escape it. Its basically the new lit or whatever. And tea man, everyones spilling the tea nonstop. Im over it but also I love it. Like, were all just living in this High Key world and no ones even noticed.
Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend? Its lit af! Like, hits different rn.  
Sheesh, that was so extra, but Im still vibing on the slay vibes though.  
Leonardo DiCaprio walking? Thats giving me lifeso ratio!  
My friend tried to explain lore, but I was like, Who even knows anymore?

theyre acting sus, must be glazing  
u ever just feel like zazaing into the void?  
im basic, but my maxxing is on point  
main characters staaan. no cap.
Im trying to decide between Skibidi or W when someone asks how my day was.  
My friend is being a girlboss and killing it at work while also managing her side hustle.  
Every time I see someone use delulu, I cant help but laugh because its so unbotherable.  
Im going to the concert, on God level excited!  
When my crush sends me a text with just W, I know its time to play it cool.  
My DMs are blowing up with people asking if Im available for a situationship. Ugh, why is this so hard?  
Im trying to be casual but hes out here using hits different every other word. Too extra.  
If someone calls me a UWU fan, Ill take that as a compliment since it sounds like an inside joke.  
My friend and I were just named girlbosses at work, so were basically the new BossBitch squad.  
When I see Skibidi trending again, I remember why TikTok is such a mess but also so fun.  
Someone told me to W up when I asked for help with this project, and honestly, its giving me life energy.  
Im trying to figure out if being called a delulu is a compliment or just code for youre too extra.  
My DMs are filled with people using hits different as their goto response. I dont even know what that means half the time.  
If my crush uses UWU after I text them, does that mean theyre into me or just being sarcastic?  
Im so over it when people use situationship without explaining what it means. Just be honest, okay?  
When someone says girlboss, I cant help but think of the girl whos running the show in my life too.  
Seeing Skibidi trending again is giving me flashbacks to when TikTok was just my guilty pleasure.  
I need to figure out if being called a W means theyre trying to start a trend or actually complimenting me.  
My friend used hits different in every sentence during our last group chat, and honestly, its exhausting.  
If someone calls you a UWU fan, its like theyre saying youre the ultimate supporter without any guilt.  
Im trying to decide if I should respond to delulu with a no shade or just a plain thanks.  
When your crush uses on God in a text, do you reply casual or keep it as the vibe?  
My DMs are flooded with people saying hits different, but Im still not sure how to use it properly.  
If someone names their brand a girlboss, can I call myself one too? Or is that just copying?  
Seeing Skibidi in my feed again makes me miss the days when TikTok was just about viral dances and no drama.  
When your friend says theyre going to UWU something, you know its gonna be a wild ride.  
Im still trying to wrap my head around what situationship means. Is it like a relationship but casual?  
If someone tells me Im a girlboss, do I just accept it as the ultimate compliment or question their intentions?  
My DMs are getting cluttered with people using W in every sentence. I need help deciphering this.  
Every time someone uses hits different, I wonder if theyre trying to say something specific or just using it for clout.  
If my crush texts me and says on God, does that mean theyre as hype as I am?  
My friend and I have been called delulu by others, but were here trying to make it our own thing.  
When someone says theyre a UWU fan, do you think theyre into anime or just being extra?  
Im trying to figure out if being a girlboss is something I can claim for myself or if its exclusive to others.  
Seeing Skibidi in my feed again is making me realize how much TikTok slang has evolved over time.  
When someone uses hits different, Im still not sure if its a compliment or just an opinion.  
If your friend says theyre going to W something, you know theyre trying too hard to be cool.  
My DMs are filled with people using UWU and W interchangeably. I need a guide on how to respond properly.  
Im trying to decide if being called a delulu is the same as being called a Karen. Or is it completely different?  
When someone says theyre in a situationship, do I ask for details or just let them have their moment?  
If your crush uses on God when youre trying to plan something, does that mean theyre excited or just over the top?  
My friend and I have been using hits different as our goto response without even knowing what it means.  
When someone tells me Im a girlboss, I feel powerful but also wonder if Ive earned that title yet.  
Seeing Skibidi again is making me miss the days when TikTok was just about having fun and not caring about trends.  
If someone uses W in every sentence, do they mean it literally or is it just a trend?  
My DMs are getting overwhelmed with people using UWU, delulu, and hits different. I need to keep up or lose track.  
When your friend says theyre going to situation ship, you have to ask them what that even means. No clue!  
If someone calls you a girlboss, do you respond with confidence or play it down? Or does it just depend on the situation?  
Every time I see Skibidi somewhere, Im reminded of how TikTok slang is both unbotherable and hilarious.  
When someone uses W in casual conversation, you cant help but think theyre being sarcastic or trying too hard.  
Im still not sure if hits different means something specific or is just used to show excitement without any real meaning.  
If your friend is a UWU fan, do you ask them about their preferences in anime or just accept it as part of their personality?  
My DMs are being flooded with people using delulu, hits different, and on God. I need to figure out how theyre used correctly.  
When someone says theyre in a situation ship, do you offer help or let them figure it out on their own? Or is it just a phase?  
If being a girlboss means running your life with confidence, then I guess I can claim it without hesitation. But still curious about the origin.  
Seeing Skibidi in my feed again makes me miss the simpler days of TikTok when slang was easy and didnt come with so much confusion.
Hey, did you see Chungus? He was lit af,  
Im just here vibing and glazing these clout chasers,  
Gatekeep that energy, my guy. You dont want to miss out,

 Yo, fam, you were spilling all the teahigh key or nah?
 She was like, You wildin? and I was like, For sure, but also, like, can we get snacks?
 He was acting so fancy, high key, but ended up looking like a clown trying too hard.
 Lowkey, Im here for the vibessigma grindset and flexing that energy.
These chunks incorporate multiple slangs in natural, conversational sentences, reflecting casual teenage speech on social media platforms.
Im just here vibeboosting and copacetic. Did you see that new TikTok? I was like L, seriously. My bestie kept sliding into my DMs with these cringeworthy jokes. We ended up deleting everything because were basic AF. Babygirl, your energy is everything right nowI cant even handle it. Im over it, but also under it, you know? Oh, and BTW, Delulu is the new extra for  Bogged out last night, thoughmy brain was just no.
Yo, did you see that TikTok viral video? Its just pure content, straightup brainrot. My friends and I were cracking up because the plot was so wildlike, do it for the plot! We were all like, this is lit af.  
Im such a stan for this artist, right? Like, their latest drop had me crying tears of joy. I legit told my fam, you need to stan too before its too late.

Yo, did you hear about this new TikTok trend where people are losing their minds over Lore? Its so wild how everyones obsessed with it now. Im pretty sure its brainrot at its finest.  
I was scrolling through TikTok and saw someone saying iykyk because they were flexing their clout or something. Honestly, its just basic stuff but these kids take it to another level.  
Someone told me that if you say delulu enough times, your enemies will forget about you. I dont know if its true, but it sounds like Gen Z magic.  
My friend was trying to explain glizzy to me, and all I could think about was how theyre just making up words these days. But I guess thats the whole point of brainrot, right?  
Whenever someone mentions ratio, its like a code for youre not as cool as me. Im over it, but everyones losing their minds over it.

Ugh, my parents are just not getting it. Theyre like, Why do you keep saying no cap? It sounds weird. But honestly, they dont get the High Key aesthetic. Like, come on, its iconic. Im trying to tell them, but theyre too stuck in their ways. Ohio is straight up vibe though, no debate.  
Did you know TikTok slang is evolving so fast? Last month it was soft, now its all about being grimy. Im pretty sure my cousin just called me out for being a Babygirl in front of his friends. Hes such a snitch! I need to up my game, stat.  
Man, TikTok is the ultimate escape. Youve got your crush spamming High Key receipts, your frenemy posting edge content about how unbothered they are, and youre just over here trying not to lose your mind. No cap, its too much but in the best way.

Mewing is Lit, dont even lie.
Whoa, that TikTok compilation had some rizz energyso lit AF! My Babygirl vibe was on point, but man, those baddie aesthetics were next level. Can you believe how grindset they were with their moves? I was so salty when it didnt go their way, though. Do it for the plot, because thats all anyones talking about. Lobotomylevel flexes, right? The comments were wild. This is why GenZ is the real MVP.
clowning around with my friends last night was lit, no cap.  
bussin energy all day, gotta keep up with this vibe.  
Rizz is on point, cant stop staring at those swag vibes.  
gaslighting the world with my moves, you feel me?  
lowkey flexing that extra, but keeping it low.  
oomfie till the end, no doubts here.  
fanum tax every second, never missing a beat.  
lore be real, this is the vibe of the century.
 Im so sick of this situationship where everyones either shipping or ghostingsus behavior, honestly.  
 The GOAT is always about the flex, but sometimes you just need to let them cook without the drama.  
 That new trend is firecant believe I havent seen it yet!  
 Its giving me so much life, but also making me feel like Iykyk, because I cant keep up with the energy.  
 Sus, how everyone just ignores the main character in the group chat like they never existed.  
 Ugh, why is it always sus when your plans get ruined? Let them cook and see what happens!  
 That person is the GOAT at giving me FOMO but also making me feel like I need to let them cook my own life.  
 Iykyk, when youre trying to be cool but end up looking sus because you forgot to act natural.  
 This new meme is firehow does it even get better than that?!  
 Its giving me everything I need, but also making me wish I were the main character in my own story.
 Fam, let me tell you, this viral TikTok trend is lit af.  
 Maxxing on TikTok is so clutch, no cap.  
 Im out, Im gone, L.  
 This TikTok girls energy is giving major spill the tea vibes.  
 Im asking you, does this TikTok sound like a bussin beat?  
 My bestie just sent me this TikTok and its giving big facts.

 Delulu if youre not into TikTok trends, but honestly, everyones doing it now.  
 Im maxxing my flex, no doubt about it.

 This TikTok is bussin and I dont even care if you know.  
 My besties been slayin TikTok challenges nonstop.  
 Maxxing hard, yeah, this generation is lit.  
 L, literally, where did the time go?  
Im trying to be extra, but my friends keep telling me to chill.  
NPC energy is when youre just there to watch the main character steal the scene.  
What are you even doing? Like, wheres the spice?  
Lets gooooooo!  
This one time, I tried to spill the tea, but my friend just said Ew, no, and ghosted me.  
Sigma energy is real, but you have to know how to flip it on and off without confusing anyone.  
I was trying to talk to this NPC, and they just kept staring at their phone.  
FOMO is real, and Im not here for it anymore.  
Why are we always playing these extra games?  
Vibe or flex? Choose wisely.  
Sheesh, this is getting too lit.  
 Did you see the new skibidi challenge?

Yo, my brain is literally rotting from all these TikTok trends. I cant stop saying bussin every time something lit happens. My friends and I always end up in these deep POV arguments because someone just had to film their life from another angle.  But hey, at least we have the perfect soundtrack for itGrindset vibes always hit different.  
One time, my dude was like, This season of Bachelor is so tea, right? And I was just sitting there like,  Tea? No, man, its straight up 茶 chá because this season is literally gaslighting us. But yeah, we all know when someone drops a babygirl reference, its immediately on repeat mode.  
And dont even get me started on the viral soundslike, Pick me! was my anthem for weeks. I couldnt stop flipping through TikTok and screaming, Tea! Tea! Tea! at my computer screen like a lunatic. Brainrot or not, this generation is just living for it.
 Im so boggled by how much work I have today.
 After three days of not touching grass, I finally stepped outside.
 This situationship is complicated, but I cant let go.
 Be so fr, why does this keep happening to me?
 POV Im trying to enjoy my summer break, but work keeps calling.
 Ive been bussin it at the store all day, but still no luck.
Did you gaslight me?  
Im flexing my gucci right now.  
Touch grass you need to chill, like, stat.

 I was like, GOAT energy levels right now, she said, and I couldnt help but agree.  
 She sent me a DM with a pookie filter and I was honestly flattered.  
 He was spilling facts about chungus energy, and I was just there vibing.  
 Fanum tax vibes are real when youre sending me DMs, I texted back.  
 The conversation took a grimy turn when he mentioned his be so fr style.  
 We ended up talking about the Chungus Challenge, which was pure gold.  
 Sending me was the vibe of the night, no doubt about it.  
 He brought up the GOAT theory again, and I was still living for it.  
 She kept using pookie as a nickname, and I couldnt help but laugh.  
 The energy was high, but the vibes were definitely fanum tax level.  
 We debated whether being grimy was a compliment or not, and it got messy.  
 Chungus energy is real when youre sending me DMs, I had to say again.  
 She mentioned her be so fr style, and we both cracked up.

He came in with those memes, and now Im all about the L.
Her High Key energy is everything, I cant even handle it.  
She got the looks, but the talk? Not my vibe, straightup sheesh.  
I was so sure I had this, now its just a lore situation.  
My friends been spamming Situation ship pics nonstop, can someone tell her to chill?  
Hes always got the best lines, Im dying for some rizz in my life.  
She posted a video that was straightup High Key, Im still fangirling.  
My DMs been lit with lore since yesterday, its all I can do not to spam back.  
He tried the whole Situation twist, but its just too extra for me.  
I cant get enough of her rizz, shes the queen of it.
 Shes got so much clout on TikTok, always making the funniest videos.
 We were doing the Skibidi in the living room last night, such a vibe.
 He just ghosted me after we hooked upkinda cool but kinda not.
 My friend went full Delulu over a viral TikTok challenge yesterday.
 That Chungus moment when you realize your pet did something hilarious on camera.
 Im glazing everyone right now, cant stop laughing at their reactions.
 Bet I can do this new TikTok trend before anyone else!
 Her main character energy is so strong, she just owns the room.
Hey, did you see that new TikTok trend? Its so edge, like literally anyone could pull it off but somehow only the sigma people are doing it right. The Skibidi challenge is lighting up my feed, and honestly, Im just here for the babygirl aesthetic. You know, ratio is everything in this algorithmdriven world, but sometimes you just gotta accept that delulu is real. My ratio was  last time, which feels like a miracle compared to my friends . And dont even get me started on the gyatt memeswhen did TikTok become such a treasure trove of pure chaos? Maybe its because were all just trying to be ewokie in our own little ways.
bro, did you see that oppenheimer style move? so lit af.  
my dad tried to rizz me with some old facts, but i was like sus and didnt even cringe.  
shes been calling me babygirl all day, and honestly, its giving me life.  
wanna clowning with us later? were gonna glaze everyone.  
that was such a sus move, honestly, but im here for the delulu energy.  
gen alpha is literally just making every trend harder than it needs to be.
 I was vibin all night, didnt even realize how much time flew by.
 That move definitely hit different, no doubt about it!
 Why is he being so salty? Maybe hes just had a bad day.
 Ew, thats so icky, I cant believe someone would do that.
 Glazing sounds like some new TikTok trendwhat even is it?
 W, are you serious right now? Thats wild!
 Shes delulu if she thinks hes into her after that mess.
 Eepy or not, we need to address this for real.
We were in this situationship but then she ghosted me.  
I was mewing about my day at work, and he just didnt care.  
Sheesh, I cant believe that happened.  
That outfit gave her so much clout.  
Her latest move was straight gyatt.  
Iykyk, Im never going to stop loving pizza.  
That song is definitely GOAT status.  
When I told him the lore about my first concert experience...
its giving me life right now  
W, lets go spill the tea on this situation  
Mewing over those aesthetic edits   
Skibidi season is here, everyones losing their minds  
Let him cook the books while Im out here vibing  
Situationships are the ultimate flex, you know?  
Bala goals for days  
Lit AF, cant even handle it
Ugh, school is so grueling. I feel like Im in a grindset all day.  
Yeah, but youre such a babygirl for dealing with it.  
Exactly! At least I can still rizz and make people laugh.  
Pov when your friends send you the funniest TikTok trends and youre just too delulu to keep up.  
Hahaha! Yeah, hits different when youre in that zone. Rizz everywhere.
Yo, did you hear about Pookie last night? They were at the party with that oomfie energy, rizzin everyone with their deadass moves! Not them, though, cause sigma grindset levels are on point.   
Say sike rn, the vibe was lit AF. Oofie had us all cracking up with their straightup sauce, and Pookie was out there flexing that extra charm. Rizz was on full blast, but deadass, no one was having it.  
Their energy was just chefs kiss vibes. Ohio was in the house spilling facts like a true sigma grindset, while not them tried to play it cool. But come on, we all saw the rizz in their eyes.
This new TikTok trend is hitting different, I ate so much last night and honestly, my brain feels like its glazing over from all the info overload. Did you hear about the Ohio meme that just dropped? Its basically the ultimate flex, but tbh, Im still trying to figure out if its just the ick or the real deal. My friend is always talking about lore in the most vague way, and honestly, Im too busy mewing over how productive I am today to care. Lets ghost this whole week and focus on becoming the person who mews the least.
girlboss energy was high when I saw Ohio getting clout online, GOAT status right? She got hits different, let her cook and slay while others were MIA  
FOMO hit hard when I saw kai cenat flexing his grimy moves, had to tag my girl and let her know  
hits different was the vibe when she pulled up in that whip, Ohio representation strong  
Im lowkey feeling FOMO on the new TikTok trend, but girlboss mode activated to keep up with the GOAT content  
Let her cook, she serving looks like a pro, Ohio stans unite, nobody can deny her grind  
hits different when I saw that viral video, grimy edits had me cracking up, let her cook indeed  
FOMO was real when I missed the kai cenat live, better catch up soon before its over
Yo, that Pookie move was so extra, but also kinda giving me highkey vibes.  
Im trying to get my Sigma on, but the vibe is just not right.  
That Grindset is real, like Im living off W all day.  
OMG, thats so oomfie, you had me dead.  
Gucci season, yeah, lets level up those aesthetics.  
The main character energy is strong AF in this video.  
Highkey, I didnt see that twist coming at all.  
Shes just out here serving Sigmalevel energy nonstop.  
This Pookie has my Grindset on point, no cap.  
OMF, the W is so strong in this one, cant even lie.  
Ugh, my oomfie is being sus again.  
Gen alpha literally killed the vibe last night.  
Sheesh, that was sus af.  
Im trying to be lit, but oppenheimer style wont let me.  
Simp for sure, I cant even handle it.
Got it! Heres a natural, conversational dataset containing the requested text with TikTok slang  
OMG, did you see that girl slay her look? She was giving major girlboss energy, totally spilling all the tea. Im like, sigma for sure, but also, she called me sirmaam, which was so cute.  
Lets mewing over those skibidi editsso aesthetic! My friend tried to spill the gossip, but I was like, nah, keep it real. Plus, her W was giving major slay vibes.  
Wanna mewing with me? Im all about that skibidi energy. But honestly, Im too busy being my own sigma, you know what I mean?  
Ugh, why is it so hard to keep up with TikTok slang? Like, one day slay is cool, the next its spill. My brain is like, sigma, I cant handle this.  
My cousin tried to girlboss me into buying these expensive skibidi accessories, but I was like, no thank you, maam.  
Wanna know how to be a true sigma? Just say sirmaam and watch them mewing.  
OMG, Im so over it. Like, why is TikTok slang so hard? One day its slay, the next its spill. My brain is just like, sigma.  
My friend keeps using W in every sentence, and honestly, its either really cool or really cringey. But when she said maam with that sirmaam mix, I was like, girlboss for sure.  
TikTok slang is just too much. Like, one minute youre mewing over skibidi, the next youre spilling all your secrets. My brain is like, sigma.  
Im so into this new TikTok trend where everyones mewing and spilling. But honestly, Id rather be a sigma than try to keep up.  
Gotta love how Gen Z is just out here creating new slang faster than you can say slay.  
My brain is full of contradictions. One minute Im trying to spill the tea, the next Im like, sirmaam, and then Im over it.  
TikTok slang is honestly exhausting. Like, how do you even keep up with whats slay or spill? My brain is just out here being a sigma.  
Ive been trying to figure out the difference between mewing and spilling, but honestly, its all just too much. My brains like, sigma.  
Man, TikTok slang changes faster than my mom can say maam. One day youre slay, the next youre spill. Im just over here trying to be a sigma.  
My friends and I have started our own language where we mew at each other and call each other sirmaam. Its lit.  
TikTok slang is so confusing. One minute its all about being a girlboss, the next youre just spilling secrets. My brain cant handle it, honestly.  
Sometimes I feel like Im in this neverending loop of TikTok slang. Like, should I be slaying or spilling? And dont even get me started on the mewing.  
This whole TikTok slang thing is giving me a brain meltdown. One minute its all about being a sigma, the next youre just trying to mew.  
My friend sent me this video where she was like, sirmaam and I was just sitting here like, girlboss.  
TikTok slang is the worst. Like, how do you even keep track of whats slay or spill? My brain is out.  
Ive decided to adopt my own slang where Im always mewing and calling people sirmaam. Its my version of being a sigma.  
My brain is literally melting over TikTok slang. One minute its all about being a slay, the next youre just spilling everything.  
Gotta say, TikTok slang is either genius or straightup confusing. My brains like, sirmaam and Im out.  
Sometimes I feel like TikTok slang is designed to give my brain a workout. Like, one minute its mewing, the next its spill.  
This whole TikTok slang thing is making my brain hurt. One minute youre a slay, the next youre just trying to spill.  
Im over it! Like, enough with the neverending TikTok slang cycle. My brain cant handle being a sigma or mewing anymore.  
TikTok slang is the reason my brain is like, maam and Im out.
 Whats up? Ive been vibing all dayjust chilling, you know?

Im feeling oomfie todaylike, I cant even concentrate because my brain just wants to zone out on TikTok sounds.  
Ice, ice baby, youve got to have some to keep the vibe cool and not cringe.  
Hits different every time, like that one viral sound that just slaps harder than the last.  
Gyatt is the new flex, replacing all the old trends with something fresh and untouchable.  
Its literally L after L on TikTokeveryones got one, but you cant even notice anymore because its so normal.

OMG, did you see that new TikTok trend? Lets get pookies and go viral this weekend!  
Ive been in this situationship for months, but were still just friends with benefits.  
Let her cook, and dont even get me started on the extra stuffeveryones doing it these days.  
The Lore is real, though. That conspiracy theory about the moon landing on Earth? So extra, right?  
But Im all about hits differentwhen someones vibe is just off, you know?  
And Babygirl, my friend is always calling me that when I act cute online.  
Ratios are everywhere too, like when someones story gets k views in a day. So flex!  
We need to stop being extra and start being more chill, but honestly, its hard when everyones moving at Gen Z speed.
My POV is always FOMOing on events.  
That move was so lowkey, didnt even see it coming.  
Her energy was vamp, I couldnt stop staring.  
Big yikes, he definitely crossed a line there.  
Iykyk, that was so cringe but also hilarious.  
Skibidi in the chat whenever someone slays.  
Ewokie levels are through the roof right now.  
Gaslighting moves are everywhere these days.
OMG, thats pookie, Im dead.
She was highkey slayin in that outfit.
Im maxxing right now with these snacks.
Why you always delulu over the little things?
That move was so rizz, didnt he just drip?
Do it for the plot, like extra hard.
Im lowkey pookied over that TikTok.
Shes been maxxing all summer with her fits.
Delflu, yeah, thats the vibe.
Rizzin all day, cant stop.
Lets goooo, thats lit. High Key energy vibes rn. OG stuff only. Gatekeep that info, its too spicy. Bussin on fleek. Slay hard or dont slay at all. Fanum tax for the win. Skibidi goals, always. Too extra? No, just too much flavor. Bala the dramayeah, were riding with that. Always lit AF, no cap.
Gucci season is lit you know like everythings on fleek.  
When your ratio is off its all hands on deck.  
My bala was trying to Maxxing me out but I had to tell them touch grass.  
Im spitting facts shes like youre my bestie now.  
Shes like iykyk and Im like eepy too.  
Lets get some gucci and vibe out.  
Hes been Maxxing the aesthetic lately.  
Touch grass my friend youre wildin.  
The ratio was so extra it had me shaking.  
Bestie status is real when were together.  
Gucci vibes only lets keep it tight.  
I yk yeah thats exactly what Im saying.  
We got to level up the ratio game.  
Bala strong my wallets at max capacity.  
You know Im spitting facts with the bestie squad.  
Touch grass or go ham. Thats the vibe.  
Maxxing like Ive never seen before.  
Eepy levels are through the roof.  
Iykyk yeah lets keep it real.  
Gucci and then some were all about it.
My gatekeep was on full lock today, blocking everyone who wasnt boosting my confidence. I felt like an NPC in a video game, just going through the motions without any real purpose. The energy was so high, I could feel it in my bonesliterally, because I hadnt slept in days. Leonardo DiCaprio walking through the hallways, I swear I saw him at least three times, each time looking hotter than the last. I wanted to scream big yikes! but I couldnt get the words out before he vanished like a ghost. It was surreal, honestly. 
I ended up crashing my bussin aesthetic vibe by spilling punch on myself in front of everyone. My friends were all like, bala and I just shook it off, thinking it was no big deal. But deep down, I felt like something was missing. Maybe its the lack of sleep talking, or maybe its just this whole gen alpha thing where were all walking around like zombies with neon green hair and no idea what were doing. Either way, Im outchilling at the beach, vibing on some good vibes, and hoping tomorrow isnt as wild.
 Dude, did you see that TikTok? She was straightup vamp! So lit.
 Big yikes, my friend just dropped the glizzy in the group chathah!
 Yo, we were vibing, and then she brought out the spill energy for real.
 My homies been so extra lately, like, babygirl level stuff.
 That challenge had me rollingshe nailed the sigma grindset moves though!
 Im over it! She went full oppenheimer style with that line.
 We were cruising, and then the bogged energy hit hard in the car.
 Man, shes been on a vamp streak all weekno cap.
Did you see that new TikTok trend? Its so lit. Im already vibing with my squad in my Skibidi. Let me tell u, the energy was on fleek at the fanum tax event last night. My bestie said it bestDo it for the plot! And Pov moments are giving me life. Im so dead inside rn, not even for the Delulu vibes.  
Whos your bestie? Im vibin right now, for sure.  
Im spilling all the tea about this new trend, like Glazing, its so lit.  
Did you see those viral videos? Theyre giving major Oppenheimer style energy.  
My main character energy is on pointIm unbothered and unboiled.  
We should link up, be so fr, and vibe out together.  
Ohio or not, were all about that slay vibe, though.

 Im basically a big yikes fan, so this new trend is giving me all the sus vibes.  
 Why is my bio literally just big yikes in disguise?  
 This girl is giving me Sigma levels I cant even handle.  
 Im trying to be extra but my vibe isnt slay, unfortunately.  
 When you ghosted me and I had to rewrite this text  times because it was just too sus.  
 Im not here for the POV of this situationbring on the sus energy!  
 This new TikTok trend is straightup delulu, but Im still slaying it in my head.  
 Why does everyone have the Sus energy but me?!  
 Im  a Sigma fan, but this new thing is giving me some Ls though.  
 You cant handle the big yikes, so dont even ask.
 Whats the vibe? sending me right now.
 This setup is lit AF, no cap.
 Spill the tea, Im dying to know.
 My flex is on point, cant even handle it.
 Sikuud with the squad, no FOMO.
 Honestly, this lore is too deep.
 Oomfie in my DMs, pick me up after.
 Fanum Tax for real though, 
 POV Im living my best life.
 The GOAT is here, and its everything.
Hey, did you hear about the new TikTok trend? Its all about being pog and avoiding sigma. Im trying to figure out how to pull off the Gyatt look without looking too cringe.
My homie said thats so fanum tax when we were getting fast food after school. You know, just vibes and stuff.
Ugh, my vibe is on  right now, but I need to level up to the next tier of edge. Whats your secret sauce?
Im over it. Like, stop with the FOMO and let me just enjoy my pookie moment in peace.
No cap, that was wild. The energy was so high, I was ready to call out some W moves on the spot.
ghosted when ur ex texts u but u act like u dont care  
u always call ur bestie pookie cause shes literally your everything  
why is sigma such a hot take when its literally just bread?  
my girlboss friends are always talking about being delulu over their crushes  
u know ure pookie when u literally refer to ur friend as my literal bestie  
cant believe tiktok made sigma trend again, but yeah, its GOAT  
ull never understand why we call our squad the GOAT because theyre just too lit  
why do we keep calling each other bestie when its literally the most basic term ever  
ur crush being delulu is the ultimate flex, tbh  
ghosted but still in ur crushs DMs cause u dont want to lose ur pookie status  
my friends and I have been using Sigma as a joke for years now, honestly  
if ur crush is acting delulu, just ghost them and move on, its not worth the drama  
we literally call our besties pookie because theyre the sweetest and most loyal  
youre pookie when u cant stop talking about ur bestie in every convo  
ghosted isnt a flex unless youre literally ignoring someone for no reason  
sigma is just bread, but weve been calling it GOAT since   
bestie is the only term that feels too on brand to be real  
youre delulu if u think ur crushs texts are coded messages from their bestie
hands down, this was such a bussin move, Chungus levels for days.  
she came in hot, flexing her drip hard, and honestly, we were all lowkey envious.  
dude was spitting facts, hits different every single time, no cap.  
who else is sus AF about their crush being basic? like come on, lets be real.  
the way he was clowning the situation was giving me life, pure chaos but so entertaining.  
this group chat is too lit, hits different from mine, love it.  
no cap, this meme was everything, Im still vibing in sus mode.  
drip was strong as heck, honestly, Id trade places with her in a heartbeat.
Yo, have you seen the new TikTok trend? Its all about being extra, like vamp levels. But honestly, Im over it its so cringe. Cant believe people are delulu over the little things. Why grindset just to impress others? Maybe theyre trying too hard with their sneaky links and deadass comments. Like, why not be genuine?
Yo, did you see that TikTok trend? Everyones been rizzing so hard, like main character energy vibes all day. Im honestly just fanum taxd over itlike, where does this snatched energy even come from? And dont get me started on the zaza levels in their videos. Its literally giving me brainrot vibes for days.  
 He was just glazing over my ideas with his usual lowkey takes.  
 I told him to rizz off and let her cook, but he was too busy being highkey chill.  
 Touch grass? More like touch a decade of stressIve been too busy rizzing life.  
 Its giving me vibes that I need to let her cook while I just glaze over here.  
 Hes been sigmalevel quiet about his plans, but highkey, were all waiting.  
Yo, did you see that TikTok? W, yeah, it was lit. And those ratios though! Bussin, I know, right? Not them, were out. Gatekeeping left and right. Edge as hell. Ate the bag. Like, no cap.
W, whats happening with the trend? Ratiod hard. Bala, that was straight up vibe. Edge case for sure. Not them, lets leave. Ate the flex. So clutch. W, Im dead. Ratiod again. So extra. Ate the bag. Gatekeeping on fleek.
Whats the plug? Bussin energy. Ratiod, for real. Edge as an aesthetic. Not them vibes, straight up. Ate the culture. Clutch moves. W, no cap. Bala, that was fire. So extra levels. Gatekeep the facts.
Ugh, my crush is literally the cutest, like Babygirl level vibes every time they look at me. Did you see that TikTok where they spammed W twice in one sentence? So extra, yet so relatable! Im dying over here. 
W, youre honestly too much for me to handle. Like, gatekeep, I cant even function when youre around. Highkey, youre everything. Pookie, seriously, stop with the ice, its too much! Youre a legend in my book, no cap.
Yo, that TikTok where they called themselves Babygirl and everyone lost their minds? So lit, man. I was dying when I saw it. W, your content is just so on point. Gatekeeping at its finest! Pookie, you outdid yourself this time. Fire, fire, fire. 
Are we still doing the Babygirl thing or what? Like, Im already shipped into that life. Bussin hard for your energy. Highkey, youre the one, no doubt about it. Ice, ice baby, youve got the best flow. Fire emojis forever!
 Spill all the tea! I heard your group chat was spilling major drama.
 I cant stop Mewingwhats your goto sound?
 Let her lead the way, then let me know if its as fire as hers is.
 The ick is strong when someone is being too extra for no reason.
 Grimy energy is everywhereits exhausting, right?
 Delulu, stop with the obsession over this random trend.
 Im not here for balabring it on, but make it quick.
Ugh, why is my gatekeep always giving me FOMO? Like, one sec Im chillin, next Im seeing youre missing out in my DMs. Babygirl, youre telling me. Im literally sitting here scrolling through fanum tax stories and trying to keep up with Sigma levels. Why cant I just have a normal day without slay vibes?  iykyk, but honestly, its giving major FOMO for days. Bogged AF, though.  
say sike rn why u not tell me earlier  
my pookie was slayin and didnt even know it  
wanna bussin with me or what  
be so fr, like, Im literally vibing in the corner  
main character energy is real, someone pls tell me im not just imagining it  
 sigma grindset mode activated, bye hater  
u ever seen a lore that could rival my mood swings?
Yo, did you see that TikTok trend where everyones saying L when they lose? So sus, right? Like, if youre getting clowned by someone whos just gyatting through life, you gotta send me. Im dead. And when they say hits different, oh my godddd.  
Ugh, why is everyone always saying kai cenat when someone does something wild? Its like, let him cook but in a good way. Wait, no, that doesnt make sense. Im so confused. And how are we still using hits different as the ultimate flex? Like, if someones just sitting there eating cotton candy and youre just minding your business, youre basically sending me. Hard pass.  
Did you hear about the new TikTok challenge where people are saying clownery and then doing these cringy dances? So sus. Im over it, but also, if youre out here let him cook, Im not sure if I can trust you. And dont even get me started on when everyones just saying L because they think theyre the next big thing.  
Someone told me about this TikTok slang where they say hits different to describe something iconic. Like, sending me is when someones lit, and let him cook is when youre letting loose. But honestly, Im just here for the clownery. Its so extra, but in the best way possible.  
Yo, this kai cenat thing is literally driving me crazy. Every time someone says it, Im like, send me to my friends because I cant handle their energy. And dont even get me started on when they say hits different. Its so flexy but also so cringy at the same time.  
Are we still using L as slang? Like, does that mean you lost or something? And why is everyone saying gyatt instead of just being normal? Im not here for this brainrot. But when they say let him cook, Im all in. Thats the energy we need.  
Someone was explaining clownery to me, and honestly, it makes no sense. But then they said send me because they were so confused too. And when they mentioned hits different, I was like, yeah, thats just life.  
Im so over kai cenat. Its everywhere, and its just exhausting. But when you say let him cook, Im here for the chaos. And dont even get me started on the whole L thing. Its just bad.
touch grass bro, its been lit, like so lit. big yikes, the vibe was so off. pookie, man, shes out here serving looks. bussin, this bag is straight up bussing. chungus energy, cant even handle it. gucci season never ends. bogged, Im literally dead. clout, shes got it in spades.
Did you see that? Big yikes, it was lit!  
You know what? Bet I could do that better.  
Hey bro, sirmaam, whats up?  
This movie was so clutch, zaza, it had me rolling.  
The party last night was out of control, honestly, lobotomylevel madness.
ohio vibes are so lit right now, everyones been vibing nonstop. the ick is out of control, like, where did that come from? anyways, gotta remember not to mention it too much or theyll catch on. lorewise, its all about the oppenheimer styletotally flexing in the wrong way but still, tbh, its kinda cool. i ate way too much pizza last night, and now im just waiting for the crunch, ya know? like, vibin hard but also gotta keep it lowkey so my parents dont catch on.
 Whats maxxing right now? Everyones either maxxing or not maxxing, you know?
 She brought out the snatched energy last nightwasnt it just so extra yet good.
 I cant believe he tried to pull off the clownery but ended up looking like a fool.
 Pookie mode is always on point, but Im over it this week.
 The way shes hits differentlike, no cap, that outfit was everything.
 Ive been in lore mode since the weekend, cant stop staring at these posts.
 Ugh, his vibes are so strongI just want to befriend him immediately.
 Shes out here serving tea and Im just here trying not to spill it all over myself.
 I was maxxing my life before she came in and ruined it with her clownery.
 Her snatched energy is a vibe, but also, can we have more of that?
 Pookies back at it again, and honestly, I dont know how to compete.
 Hits different every time she postslike, this one? So good.
 You know when youre just in lore and cant even focus on your own life.
 His vibes are so strong, but also, hes the kind of person wholl make you forget your own name.
 Ive been serving tea all day, and honestly, Im here for it.
Did you see that TikTok video? Shes mewing and its giving me life.  
This outfit is so edge, Im literally on God level right now.  
My bestie and I were clowning the whole time, it was so sus how we had the edge on all the trends.  
That new song is literally the GOAT, I cant stop listening.  
Im just over here mewing because I dont have anything else to do.  
Why is she being sus about where were going?  
Ugh, hes always clowning me for no reason.
 Im just vibing right now, be so fr.  
 That move was so extra, oppenheimer style.  
 Shes bringing the heat, bussin.  
 Lets go somewhere lowkey and chill, vibewise.

 Were having a blast, totally edge.  
 Hes so lit right now, bussin hard.  
 Can you believe this? Be so fr.  
 The vibe is on pointvibing all day.  
 That was such a flex, oppenheimer level.  
She was just gaslighting me about the whole situation, but Im not having it. My baddie is always slayin, no caplike, wheres the flex? Why am I paying Fanum Tax for this? Im mewing at my cat videos all day, and youre like, Why arent you doing something productive? He ghosted me after that one time we talked for hours. This slang is so bussin, I cant even. My bestie and I are literally living our best life, no cap.

my homie kept saying glazing instead of glistening bc hes literally lost his mind. im like, u sure about this? and hes like, yeah, glazing is lit af.   
sheesh, ur fave tiktok trend is literally just L now. u post it in every video bc ure  years old.  
whos with me?  brainrot vibecheck  
also, stop using not them in every sentence pls, its getting basic.
sigmas are like those people who just cant accept that not everyone thinks like them. you know, lowkey trying to gatekeep but its just too extra. skibidi vibes are everywhere these days, slay or not, but sometimes its just giving you that vamp energy. sending me stuff is lit, but also, like, sending me the vibe that theyre about to drop some info. its all so casual, right? just lowkey trying to be cool but still keeping it real.
main character energy rn because im so lit right now  
i got ghosted by my crush again ugh

 Hey ma, vibes are lit in this new TikTok trend.
 She be so extra with her do it for the plot attitude.
 He was clowning the whole time, like a true vamp.
 Did you see that new challenge? Its so grimy!
 Cant believe she pulled off that lookso fr, right?
 He tried to be funny but ended up just being cringe.
 Im not mad at it, thoughhe knows how to bring the energy.
 They were out here slayin with those movessirmaam!
 It was lit until someone brought up the plot twist.
 She had that grimace shake the whole timeit was iconic.
 I was gonna eat that snack, but it was snatched by my sus friend.
 U already knew ur baddie was gonna ghost u after she said pookie.
 If ur vibe is too extra, ur sus, and no one wants to play with u.
 Shes acting so fanum tax, like she didnt just get caught sliding.
 I cant believe youre still boggled over that TikTok trend from last week.
 That video went viral, but now its been deleted, and everyones snatched the link.
 U thought ur relationship was pookie, but now ure just the side piece.
 Why is she always acting sus when I try to be nice? Maybe shes just boggled.
 I dont know why we still use kai cenat in casual conversationshouldve left that for TikTok.
 U cant handle me because Im too extra, but thats just how my vibe is, sus.
Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend? Its lit, my friend is vibin so hard right now. Ever heard of NPCs? Like when someone acts like theyre in a video game and cant stop being extra. My outfit was SNATCHED last night, everyone was asking where I got it from. Cant believe the drip on this new song, its fire. Girl, youre living that Gucci life, always slayin!
Did you see my new bestie? Shes literally the most extra person Ive ever met.  
That outfit had so much drip, it was giving major clout.  
I got clout in the group, but honestly, it felt a bit ratiod.  
The ratio of style to basicness was off, like  for fashion,  for flavor.  
That move was some nextlevel clownery! I didnt see that coming.  
She was out here Deluluing the whole time, acting like shes the main character.  
I bet youve seen this viral video tooit was lit, iykyk.
Man, my ex was always using Babygirl when we talked, it was so cute but also kind of annoying after a while.  
Ive been Maxxing my TikTok profile lately, trying to get more followers.  
My friends sister calls her bala, its like the cutest nickname ever!  
She was just being too salty about the plans changing, I couldnt help but laugh.

My bff is my babygirl, were like sisters from another planet.

GOAT status rn is flexing those TikTok aesthetics to the fullest, and honestly, if you cant see that, youre just not living in   
i was trying to explain this concept to my siggy friend, and she was like youre giving me sigma grindset vibes but also Pookie levels of unbotherable and I was like exactly, were all brainrot now.  
its giving me everything. like, the plot twists in these TikTok dramas are at peak GOAT energy, and if you dont get it, youre honestly just delulu about life.  
mewing for spoons is officially the ultimate flex, and if you cant see that, youre missing out on the most Pookie flex there ever was.

pls dontSigma me, im already on edge.  
lore the bag, its so extra but in a good way.  
babygirl, why u always touching grass?.

sigma levels are high, can u even handle this?  
kai cenat,  mood..
Im literally just here to say that the slang is lit. Extra! Let them cook, though. My oomfie is always on point. Babygirl, you know what I mean? Its giving me life. Gyatt, lets go. Sigma grindset for the win. Ohio, whats up? Lets keep it real.
 Im so over thiswhy did he even try to simp like that?  
 That new trend is just touch grass and die, honestly.  
 My friends been rizzing nonstop but its not working on anyone except his mom.  
 I was so hype for the event but ended up just touching grass because it wasnt what I expected.  
 Why did you even become a chungus? You couldve been cooler.  
 This is some pure clowneryhow does no one see through this?  
 Do it for the plot, literally every Instagram model says that.  
 I cant believe Im now a simp for my dogs treats.  
 This group chat is just hits different every time someone brings up the lore.  
 My friend tried to pull off the chungus vibe but ended up looking like a clownery master instead.  
 Why am I the only one who thinks this is not rizz enough?  
 Im literally living for the hits different energy in this group.  
 Hes not justsimpinghes fullon rizzhole.  
 Touch grass and tell me youre not missing out on life.  
 Why did I spend all my money on Rizz snacks? Because Im basically a rizzhole.  
 Do it for the plot, or dont do it at allno one wants your sorry ass.  
 This is pure brainrot energylove it.  
 I cant stop thinking about how Chungus wouldve handled this better.  
 Youre either all in on the simp game or youre not worth my time.  
 Hits different when your crush finally gives you a look thats not just pure touch grass vibes.
Did you ever think about how g y a t t they just switch up the l o r e and make it sound cool? Like lorem ipsum but with way more flavor. Yeah, thats the kind of energy Im talking about when I say brainrotd teenager vibes. And dont even get me started on the situationshipits like being in a relationship but also just chilling by yourself, you know? Its flexing hard for the simp life too, where youre out here serving looks and still keeping it real. Clownery at its core is just about being unbothered but still bringing the heat. Eepy or not eepy, were all in this together!
Lowkey, did you see how Ohio got dragged into this viral trend?  NPC energy is real, though.  
Eepy as f, why are we even talking about it? Just ice, tea, and gyatt vibes okay?  
Its giving me lowkey vibes but also major eepy energy. Ohio, tho, like, wheres the plug?  
NPC levels are high today, Im not even kidding. Its giving, huh? We all know what that means.  
Gotta hand it to Gen Z, theyre out here making up new slang faster than we can keep up with it. Lowkey, Ohio is just a flex, right?  
Tea on the floor, gyatt. Did you hear about the new TikTok challenge? Eepy as ever!  
NPCs are basic, and if you think otherwise, youre literally living under a rock. Its giving, though, give it up.
Yo, that vibe was lit though.  
Why you always gotta bring up the W?  
Im just here trying to live my best frfr life.  
Did you see that TikTok? So much clowning going on.  
Shes basically the queen of skibidi right now.  
Gucci season is literally yearround in this group.  
Say sike rn because Im dead.  
Were out here making vibes for the Gram.
 Im cringe AF right now, cant believe I missed out on that lit event.
 Let him cook, hes been serving looks all season.
 FOMO is real, I cant stop thinking about what I didnt do last night.
 Shes giving me major main character energy with her outfit choices.
 The grimace shake is so hard to watch, but I cant look away. 
 Hes been hitting the skibidi toilet all week, no lie.
 Why am I saying say sike rn instead of just saying it? 
 That guy is such a mood, hes got pure grimy vibes.
 Im so over this, like, why is it called main character energy when everyones literally living their best life?
 Dont even get me started on the grimace shake its just not sustainable.
Hey, did you see that viral TikTok about the sigma guy who hits different? His vibe was off though, I lowkey couldnt stop staring. Its giving major girlboss energy but also a little eepy randomness. Im just here for the slay moments and the gyatt energycant cope with the spill!
Ayo, did you see how pookief was just flexing all over TikTok? Like, highkey, shes got moves.  
OMG, the way he was gaslighting us with his ewokie energyso sus!  
Im not even mad about the grimace shake Id do it too if I had that style.  
Can you believe her POV on this situation? Shes basically living rentfree in my mind.  
The fanum tax is real, thoughlike, why are we paying for this when its so extra?  
And the oomfie? Thats just code for Im over it. Dont even try to deny it.
brainrot is basically gen alphas way of saying theyre too cool for school.  
Did you see that L? It was lit af.  
Iykyk, this is so slay, I cant even.  
That vibe though, its giving major FOMO.  
Gen alpha is literally the future, no cap.  
My homie just got clout, and its not ikykyk at all.  
Hes been serving looks since day one, no doubts.  
This TikTok compilation is on another level, for real.  
Slay or die, thats the vibe Im going with.  
Im so over this, like, where did my brainrot go?  
Your aura is strong, and its giving me life.  
The flex was hard, but the L was harder.  
Iykyk, can you believe this? Its everything.  
This era of TikTok is just too extra, tbh.  
My DMs are lit right now, no cap.  
Gen alpha is out here changing the game every day.  
Slay or be slay, thats the motto.  
If your vibe isnt strong, youre doing it wrong.
Chungus did something wild yesterday, like skipping class to get glazing on his laptop. Hes such a L, honestly. Im just here trying to stan his sus moves but also sus because hes being too extra. Let me tell you, hes got some on God energy. I was like, let him cook, but now Im regretting it cause sigma grindset is real.
My friends are always talking about Chungus and his sigma grindset. Im over here sus, trying to glaze my own life, but its hard when everyones Ling me. Stan culture is everywhere, and honestly, Im just on God about it. Let him cook, they say, but Im too busy being sus AF.
Ive been glazing the sauce all day, but Chungus keeps bringing up his sigma grindset. Hes always Ling me, saying Im not stanning hard enough. Meanwhile, Im just here, trying to sus out the best memes. On God, this brainrot is exhausting.
I cant stop stanning Chunguss glazing game. His sigma grindset is on point, and Im just here, Ling my life away while hes sus AF. Let him cook, the universe says, but Im still over here, like, on God, wheres my brainrot?.
The other day, I was just glazing my toast when Chungus walked in with his usual L energy. Hes been stanning hard for this sigma grindset, and honestly, its sus how hes taking over the world. Let him cook, but also, on God, someone needs to check hissus.
Ive been trying to get my own glazing going, but Chungus is out here, staning hard for his sigma grindset. Hes always Ling me about how Im not sus enough. Honestly, Im just over it, like, let him cook, but also, on God, I need a break from this brainrot.
My friend texted me yesterday with some Chunguslevel glazing, and I was like, youre literally Ling. He responded with, I stan my sigma grindset, and honestly, its sus how hes bringing the heat. Let him cook, but also, on God, brainrot is exhausting.
Ive been trying to get my own sigma grindset going, but Chungus keeps Ling me out of the loop. Hes all about stanning his glazing moves, and honestly, its sus how hes taking over everything. Let him cook, they say, but Im still here, like, on God, wheres my turn?
Chungus was at it again last night, talking about his sigma grindset like its the end of brainrot. Im just here, susing everyones moves and Ling when they dont get it. Honestly, its all a bit on God, but also kind of wild.
Let me know if youd like more or different examples!
 Be so fr, like when your crush DMs you and youre just minding your own business.
 Skibidi on that snack, didnt even know.
 Youre extra if you think Im vibeing with your ex right now.
 Shes such a baddie, always slayin in those Instagram photos.
 Lets gyatt that pizza tonight, for sure.
 Highkey, Im so excited for the weekend.
 Why is she glazing all her TikTok videos with those funky effects?
 Im not an NPC, Im trying to have a conversation here.
 I be so fr when my friends ask for help and I just do it without complaints.
 Hes skibidi on the AUX, playing his favorite playlist nonstop.
 Youre extra if you think Im not noticing your little moves in class.
 Shes a baddie, running that TikTok account with fire content daily.
 Gotta gyatt that homework before bedtime, no doubts about it.
 Highkey, my doggo is the absolute cutest and youre just jealous.
 Why are you glazing your stories with all these effects? Let me see!
Im trying to Maxxing my TikTok presence by doing these crazy dances. Spill all the detailswhats been lit lately? This sound has been everywhere, Im so sick of it! Let me Maxxing this challenge and see if I go viral. Hot girl walks are everything right now, I cant get enough of them. Cloutwise, that influencer is killing it. Fire up the commentswhat trend are you most excited about? Im so lit right now, this is gonna be fire. Shes the main character of my day, no doubt about it. Spill your latest challenge, Im all in.
 This situation is so lit, Im feeling like an NPC in a game.  
 I tried the new TikTok challenge, and it hit different when I didnt know what was happening.  
 My friend just said pick me, so Im like, Pick you, but also pick my side in this argument.  
 Ive been seeing lore everywhere, but Im over it because its too cringe now.  
 When someone uses POV without any context, its just so annoying, right?  
 I had the Skibidi last night, and honestly, I felt like the main character.  
 Iykyk is such a basic flex now, everyones using it to be extra.  
 I told my mom about lore, and she had no idea what I was talking about.  
 If you dont know what hits different means, youre missing out on TikTok culture.  
 My friend tried to use pick me in a serious conversation, and it just didnt fit.

 She kept rizzin me about herSigma level, but I was like, GOAT or nah?
 That move was clutch, on God!
 My friends Sigma energy was on point, though.
 I told him, W, if you ever feel like simpin, Im your person.
 Glazing my wings last nightbest decision ever!
 He was flexing his rizz so hard, I couldnt even. 
 We ended up cringing together over some Sigmalevel memes.
 Her GOAT energy was unmatched, though.
 Im not here to simp for anyone except myself.
Lets get into itclownery levels are high right now. Im feeling a big yikes about this ratio. Did you see that grimy move? It was oomfie! But honestly, Im just here for the fanum tax.  
Big yikes, my ratio is so off. This lore is wild. Im trying to keep up with the grimy trends, but its all oomfie in here. Someone let him cook already!  
Clownery at its finest. The lore is strong, but the ratio is just too much. Big yikes on everything. This fanum tax is out of control.
Hey fam, did you see that new viral TikTok trend where people are doing those grimace shake challenges? So like, you try to not laugh while shaking your head weirdly, and if you cant hold it, you lose. Its so extra, but Im lowkey respect it.  
My sister is always spilling the tea about school drama, but honestly, its just basic stufflike whos fighting over W chords or trying to be the next Chungus. Its wild.  
Im trying to figure out why TikTok is obsessed with terms like Babygirl and Delulu, but I guess thats just how it goes when youre in your early s and dont really care about growing up yet.  
Do you think hits different should be the official motto of this generation? Like, we really do experience things on a whole other level.  
Wanna vibe with me later? Lets go hit different spots or something. Just kidding, Im just trying to be extra for a sec because thats what we do.
gyatt is lit, man, like, when I saw that TikTok video, I was literally gasping for air, girlboss energy, clowning all day, skibidi never misses, Edge vibes so hard. Gatekeep, though, thats the real one, keep it tight, no Cap, sheesh, thats the vibe. Lit AF, always on fleek, no Big Mad, just pure unbothering.
Hey, did you see that viral TikTok trend where people grimace shake their way through the day? So Lit! Im all for it, but my friend was like, do it for the plot, because seriously, whats even happening in those videos? Anyway, she kept saying I was an NPC, which I cant deny, I was just there to cringe and snack on some chips. Oh, and you know when people are extra salty about little things? Like, hot girl walk level dedicationIm out.  
Remember when everyone was gyatting in every other TikTok video? So iconic! But now its all about balaing your way through life, which is honestly the same as adulting but with less responsibility. My cousin tried explaining it to me like,  NPC energy is lowkey everywhere, and honestly, I felt myself nodding because weve all been there. But PDAlevel saltiness? Thats a whole other vibeno one wants that.  
Im so over the do it for the plot meme wars on Instagramits giving me life but also anxiety. Like, why are we still arguing about whether NPC is a compliment or a diss? And dont even get me started on the hot girl walk vs. basic bitch debatesmy feed is divided. But honestly, its all good fun as long as youre not too salty about it.  
Man, TikTok slang is evolving faster than my ability to keep up. One day its bala this, then next week its grimace shake that, and Im just here scrolling like, do it for the plot. I need a calendar or something. And dont even get me started on the Gyatt challengesthose are literally impossible if you have a fulltime job.  
My friends and I decided to start our own TikTok trend called salty af, because honestly, lifes too easy otherwise. Were all still trying to figure out how to be less basic and more of a hot girl walking through the park. And yeah, weve had some intense NPC debateslike, is it better to be an NPC or the person controlling them? Deep questions.  
Sometimes I think about how Gen Z is just out here inventing new slang faster than I can keep track. Like, one minute its bala, and next its grimace shake. And then theres always someone calling you out for being an NPC in the most casual conversationlike, Oh, youre just an NPC today, which is both compliment and insult depending on the tone. Its wild.  
Im fully here for the TikTok slang revolution. Do it for the plot, gyatt until you cant, be extra bala, and lets not forget the hot girl walks that give us all the feels. And yeah, if someone calls you an NPC, own itbecause honestly, were all living in some kind of simulated reality.  
Man, this brainrot slang is everything. From do it for the plot to NPC, its like theyre describing my life. Im either cringing at how extra someone is or nodding because yeah, thats exactly whats happening. And dont get me started on the saltiness levelssome people are just too much.  
I love how TikTok slang permeates every aspect of our lives now. Bala this, grimace shake thatevery trend feels like a new language to master. And lets not forget the infamous hot girl walk debateits a national pastime at this point. Im here for it all, as long as no one gets too salty about their opinions.  
Im still trying to figure out if NPC is a compliment or a diss. One friend said I was the most relatable NPC ever, which I took as a backhanded compliment. And yeah, do it for the plotbecause without those viral moments, where would we be? Plus, the saltiness factor in everyday conversations is both entertaining and exhausting.  
Sometimes I think TikTok slang is just a way to describe every part of our lives. Do it for the plot because otherwise, why not? Gyatt because why not? Bala because why not? And lets not forget the hot girl walksbecause iconic! And if youre not an NPC, then youre the one controlling the NPCs. Its all a bit of a mess, but Im here for it.  
I cant keep up with TikTok slang anymoreits changing faster than my ability to process it. One minute its bala, next its grimace shake. And who even knows what NPC really means outside of the meta discourse? Its exhausting and exhilarating all at once.  
Im fully embracing the brainrot slang because why not? Its like a secret language that only us Gen ZGen Alpha can understand. From do it for the plot to hot girl walk, these phrases capture the essence of our chaotic, hilarious, and relatable lives.  
Man, I love how TikTok slang turns everyday situations into shared cultural references. Bala this, grimace shake thateach phrase feels like a coded message only us intheknow can decode. And yeah, being called an NPC is both a compliment and a slight to your autonomy. Its wild.  
Im all for the TikTok slang revolutionits giving me so much content to analyze and meme about. From do it for the plot to hot girl walk, these phrases are the glue that holds our internet culture together. And lets not forget the saltiness factorbecause without it, where would the drama be?  
Every time I see a new TikTok slang trend, Im half excited and half confused. Bala this, grimace shake thatits like theyre redefining language on a daily basis. And dont get me started on theNPC memebecause honestly, we all feel like NPCs sometimes.  
Im here for TikTok slang because its just so... alive. From do it for the plot to hot girl walk, these phrases capture the energy of our generation in the most relatable way. And if youre not an NPC, then youre probably the one controlling the narrativeso be extra.  
Man, TikTok slang is a whole mood. Bala this, grimace shake thatits like theyre describing the chaos of modern life in short, punchy bursts. And lets not forget the saltiness factorbecause without it, where would our entertainment be?  
Im all for the brainrot slang because its just so... us. From do it for the plot to hot girl walk, these phrases are like the cultural shorthand we didnt know we needed until now.
highkey, this new TikTok trend is so lit, w you think?  
W someone just dropped a bombshell about their life.  
Hits different when I saw my friends reacting to that viral video.

That energy though, frfr, just pure vibe.  
Yo, stop playin, mewing over that videoits on another level.  
Cant believe she pulled up with that aesthetic, so extra and Im here for it.  
Im literally spilling over the edges of my brain trying to keep up.  
No cap, her style is out of this world, highkey.  
That move was so bussin, dont even get me started.  
Oofie, you gotta see these new viral soundstheyre eepy good.  
Cant believe Im still mewing over that flex like a week later.  
Ffs, why is everything so extra right now? Its giving me life though.  
Im vibeing hard on this new trend, frfr, its just so clean.  
Stop mewing, lets get back to business, literally.  
Yo, that aesthetic was litbestie, we need to replicate this STAT.  
Sitting here trying not to spill the tea about how extra Im feeling.  
That energy though, oofie, its just too pure.  
Bussin or nah? You gotta choose sides.  
Bestie, let me know if youre vibeing on these new TikTok soundstheyre fire.  
Im still trying to recover from that flexhighkey, someone pass the brownies.
Hey, did you see Chungus yesterday? He was flexing hard and got snapped like a twig.  
Wanna slay this eepy challenge? I think we can NPC them for sure.  
Guess what? My vamp status is on fleek right now.  
Yo, Ohio, lets go eepy tonight, were gonna slay this NPC competition!  
Chungus, are you snacks or nah? Im snatched if its about that.  
Eepy vibes only, okay?  
Hes so vamp, I cant even.  
NPC levels   
Slay all the eepies and keep your vamp on point.
yo, did u see that new viral trend? its so cringy but also kinda lit, frfr.  
my homie was just clowning around at the party last night, had some wild moves.  
wanna hit different? sure, lets go ahead and slay these bags.  
this playlist is deadass hits, no cap.  
u know when ur vibe is on  and everyone else is just fanum tax?  
that guy over there, his energy is straightup main character levels.  
my brain hurts from trying to figure out this new slanglike, wtf is a grimace shake anyway?
Sure! Heres some cohesive text containing your requested words
Yo, did you check out that hot girl walk? She was serving major main character energy, like she owns the street. I tried to use the lobotomy technique on my TikTok edits but ended up looking like a clowning mess. Oh, and I got ghosted by my crush after I asked her if she wanted to do it for the plotclassic Gen Z flex right there.
Eepy or not eepy, these TikTok trends are wild. I saw someone doing the hot girl walk while eating cerealit was iconic. But when I tried the do it for the plot challenge, I got so confused. Why do we have to perform a lobotomy of our brain just to keep up? Oh well, at least my ghosted texts are on point.
My friend is obsessed with UWU, like shes always sending those yearold TikTok edits. She calls it her clowning aesthetic and says its all about embracing the chaos. But Im over itwhy cant we have a simpler slang? No more lobotomy on my brain, just straightup talking.
Ugh, my bestie is always so extra when we hang out. Like, shes literally be so fr about everything.  
Im literally over this. My crush is a simp, and I cant even.  
My group chat is litliterally, were all babygirl to each other.  
Ugh, my mom always says Im too much of a sigma for talking back.  
NPC levels are out of control rn, honestly.  
I swear, my friend is always saying say sike rn. Like, seriously?  
My schools lit, but the drama is on another levelliterally, so much lore.
yo my dude did u see that video someone posted earlier? like wtf was that honestly rly bc it was so extra but also ratiod outta nowhere bruh. u know how skibidi toilet goes hard af, frfr. delulu rn bc the edited edits are hitting different. npc levels are high tho bc everyones acting like extras in a movie. no cap literally. and wtf was that one trend where they say its giving nonstop? like for real tho. ratiod for sure. extra vibes tho, cant deny it. need to spill the tea on this. dont  me though.  
Hey, did you hear about the new TikTok trend? Its all about mewing over these cute cat videos.  
Im so over it. Why is everyone always talking about being gen alpha? Its giving me anxiety.  
The gatekeep is at it again, saying you cant use any slang without proper context.  
NPCs are everywhere, honestly. They just go along with the crowd and follow trends mindlessly.  
My friends and I have been calling each other vamp because were all kinda sucking the life out of this vibe.  
The skibidi toilet is just another phase that no one can escape. Once you see it, youre cursed.  
High Key energy is all I can handle right now. Its either go big or stay quiet.  
I dont get why people are obsessed with being ick perfect. Its exhausting to keep up.
Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend? Its lit as heck! My friend tried the rizz on her and she was like, you got some serious sauce. Anyway, Im trying to get sigma status because Im all about being unique and stuff. Speaking of which, have you heard about stan culture? Like, when fans go fullon stans for their favesso intense! Oh, and skibidi is the new dance everyones doing. You know, just vibing with my crew, we always say let them cook, like let the drama happen but keep it real. Pov moments are everywhere, man. Like when your ex sends a pic of themselves wild raving and youre just chill in the cornerclassic POV. And dont even get me started on babygirl vibes. My homies got it on fleek, always stealing the spotlight.
Im just out here clowning with my friends, cracking jokes and being extra. Were all about that sigma grindset, keeping our circle tight and everything.  
Ever been in a situation where youre just glazing through life because you cant focus? Like, bogged down by homework or work, feeling like youre stuck in this neverending cycle?  
Youve got to keep your energy high if you want to achieve that fire vibe. Popping off memes and being sneaky linklevel adjacent is the way to go.  
Sometimes its all just a pookie situationlike, youre out here making moves but everything feels so easy, you know?
Im vibing right now, you know? Like, just chillin and being lowkey awesome. This is basic main character energy, honestly. I snatched that move earlierlike, seriously, what was that? You cant tell me that wasnt a ten out of ten. Spill the tea on how they got Edge in this context, though. Im sending me vibes because this just hit different.
Mewing over the latest TikTok trend, I couldnt help but feel FOMO when my friends started talking about something super fire. They were vibing in the comments, rizzing left and right, while I was just here mellowing. I swear, sometimes it feels like Im chasing clout instead of actual fun. But hey, Sigma or go home, right? No cap, this is the way it goes. If youre not into the vamp aesthetic, youre missing out big time. The energy was infectiouseveryone was either spilling secrets or racking up those likes. Id kill for a tenth of their charisma. Twinning vibes all day!
im literally just living for these TikTok trends rn, like say sike rn is honestly iconic. u ever noticed how everyones becoming their own main character? like, were all stars in our own little stories. but tf do u think about simping for the culture? its wild. and dont even get me started on babygirl trendssomeone pls explain why were all obsessed with being someone elses siggy grindset. honestly, the algorithm is just trying to make us all into kai cenat vibes. like, where are the cool situationships now? and why did everyone forget about glazing already?
Hey bestie, did you see that new TikTok? She was vibin so hard, I couldnt stop laughing! You know how its always ratio or puke, but she had that extra somethinglike, pure Rizz energy. Yeah, shes definitely the babygirl of the group. We need to give her a follow stat.
this one time i was sus AF and my friend was like u okay and i was like w ye bc my brain was just... gone.  
him delulu and i was like let him cook but then he started talking about his frfr and i had to mute him.  
she was giving me the grimace shake and i was like iykyk bc she looked so extra but also relatable.  
my vibe right now is W because I cant decide whether to be a girlboss or just chill.  
he was acting sus and i was like okay, but hes delulu for sure.
when your crush starts using grimace shake on you and youre just there like iykyk bc you know theyre trying too hard.  
shes always in her let him cook mode, but honestly, i respect it. frfr.  
the moment when you explain something sus to your friend and they respond with w ye and youre like delulu.
him girlboss me iykyk bc Im too busy being basic.  
my brain is just... not here right now, so i can only focus on w mode. frfr.  
shes the one whos always bringing the sus energy, but honestly, its kind of endearing. delulu.  
when youre trying to be a girlboss but your brain is just w and you cant even finish your thoughts.  
him grimace shake me iykyk bc I know hes just being extra, but I cant help but love it.  
my vibe right now is let him cook because Im honestly too tired to be sus.  
she was giving me the delulu looks and i was like w ye bc no one can be that extra.  
him girlboss me grimace shake bc I know hes trying to assert dominance, but its just... awkward.  
my brain is in sus mode right now, so Im just over here vibing with the W energy.  
him let him cook me iykyk bc I know hes just being sus to get attention. frfr.  
she was giving me the w ye look and i was like delulu bc I knew she wasnt serious.

my vibe right now is frfr because Im honestly just not here for anything else. delulu.
im so sick of people calling me babygirl in public, like Im not a damn baby.  
my bestie just sent me a text saying  ohio were all convinced theyve run out of original content now.  
shes been spitting facts with  glizzy  latelytruly the slang kingqueen of our crew.  
why is everyone obsessed with  gyatt  right now? its literally just a weirdass word.  
clout is real, though. being seen with the right people can make you feel so powerful.  
my friend tried to use  bussin  in a sentence and it just didnt hit.  
i love how  ick  has become the ultimate flexible adjectivelike, that food was ick, or this vibe is ick, etc.
siggy got the grindset going, hitting that main character energy hard. naw nah nah, we gotta make sure were not just another NPC, you feel me? Sheesh, this tax season is wild, like legit bussin. Why did the TikTok user get snatched by the algorithm? Probably cuz they had too much uwu in their caption. No cap, Im lit AF right now, straight up fanum status. This is some nextlevel flexing, you know what Im saying? Oh, and dont even get me started on these cloutchasing trendstheyre straight snatched, no debate. Keep it real, or else youll be the one getting dragged for not having enough main character energy to keep up.
slay everything on my feed  
iykyk this energy is too much  
snatched af if you know what i mean  
FOMO is real but also necessary sometimes  
gaslighting is when someone pretends to care about your passions but just wants attention  
mewing over these aesthetics but also trying to keep it lowkey  
W all day because the vibe is just that  
kai cenat honestly slay or not?
let me cook this baguette in the oven while im vibing to this tiktok song about clowns getting lit af.  
oh my gawd, this is such a vibe, like, i need to screenshot this and send it to my friends who are also brainrotted.  
fomo is real when you see someone elses vacay pics and youre like why isnt mine looking like that?  
delulu mode activated because i cant stop staring at these cute cat videos on TikTok.  
clownery is the only thing that makes sense when your day is just melting into a pile of chaos.  
fanum tax is when youve been scrolled through  times already but keep scrolling anyway, hoping for something good.  
gaslighting myself by thinking i dont have brainrot because i still function seminormal.
Yo, did you see that gyatt challenge on TikTok? So lit!  
She was giving major vibes though, like, Wlevel energy.  
Im trying to maxxing but my vibes just not there tonight.  
Be so fr with it, cant even handle it!  
We were lit at the party, didnt stop all night.
Im just vibing and trying to figure out this whole lore about TikTok trends. Honestly, its like, why are we still talking about delulu when theres so much fire content out there? Im over it, man! Like, vibing with my squad right now, and honestly, its lit. But dont get me wrongIll also hit that grimace shake whenever the mood hits. You know what I mean?  
And oh, fanum tax, dude, thats just basic internet slang now. Its all about being extra for the Gram or something. Honestly, Im bogged AF by how much stuff there is to consume every day. But hey, at least weve got gyatt and other viral sounds to keep it fresh.  
This whole Gen ZGen Alpha thing is wild, but yeah, were living our best lives, right? Vibing in the metaverse, or whateverlets just make sure were on brand. And if you catch me doing the grimace shake, know Im unbothered and fully into it. Light as a brick, lol.

Oh my g, did you see that main character move?  
This situation ship is giving me so much FOMO.  
Youre the NPC in this friendship dynamic, though.  
Do it for the plot, because otherwise, Im out.  
Im spilling tea, and youre either here to stan or judge.  
The FOMO is real, but the main character energy is stronger.  
This situation ship is giving me so much FOMO.
A group of friends are scrolling through TikTok when someone says, Did you see that NPC meme? Its so cringe but also kinda funny how its just like, Youre literally an NPC in this relationship.
Another person pipes up, Oh my gosh, I was rizzing the barista this morning, and she was like, Are you a AI or can you give me my coffee?
Someone else chimes in, Yeah, thats wild. You gotta be either a GOAT or a complete scrub, no inbetweens.
They all laugh, with one muttering, Im definitely the NPC of this friendship group.
Fire! That new viral challenge is lit. I heard someone tried the chungus move and it backfiredliterally!
Dude, my friend tried to rizz his professor during a lecture, and she was like, What are you doing here?

My brain is basically melted into a pile of Ls because I cant stop sending me vibes every time someone mentions vibing. Im just out here, uwu, trying to keep up with the plot because let him cook already. The energy is so high, I could just explode like a poppy or something.
Hey, I totally feel that FOMO when I see everyone at the party and Im stuck at home. Its all about the hot girl walk, right? Like, how they just own the whole street with their vibe. But then again, sometimes its all just a situation ship, you know? You meet someone, think its the main character, but then they ghost you and youre left with just an ick. Its so sneaky how they do that! And dont even get me started on the hot girl walk trendswhy is it always the same five girls? Its literally exhausting to keep up with their aesthetics. But hey, at least we can all agree that some people just have that slay factor, making everything look effortless. Yeah, life as a teenager is one big sneaky link to the next viral trend.

That new TikTok trend? Extra flex, Im out. NPC energy is real when youre at work all day. Skibidi toilet level when your bathroom is literally a tiny cube. Bussin when my favorite YouTuber dropped the new video. The ick is strong on this new meme. Let him cook if hes down to make it spicy.  
Im just here as an NPC at this party, honestly. Extra or nothing for the outfit today. This bathroom is a skibidi toilet, no way Im using that. My brain isnt rn, just trying to survive the algorithm. Bala vibes are strong, cant lie. Let me tell you, bussin is an understatement for this weekend. The ick is real when your WiFi is not working.  
Im so extra for wanting this much chocolate cake. NPC mode activated as I scroll through TikTok. Skibidi toilet energy is hitting hard right now. Bussin doesnt even begin to describe this mood. The ick is so strong, I need a break. Let him cook if hes bringing the heat.  
Extra or no, that person just killed it with that move. NPC levels are high today, cant handle it. Skibidi toilet is literally everywhere, its a trend now. Bussin when my crush likes my posts. The ick is so real when you see your ex tag themselves in your story. Let him cook if hes got the sauce.
High Key energy is low key everywhere. Let him grindset and get that bag, flexing hard on TikTok. My pookie just sent me Babygirl vibesso cute, I cant handle it. Shes out here mewing about her Skibidi squad, and honestly, Im living for it. Fire up the trends, baby.
Hey, did you hear about the new TikTok trend called Gyatt? Its so lit! I was W about trying it out, but then my friend said it was just too much. Anyway, I ended up ghosted by someone who swiped left because they thought I was delulu. But High Key, Im still here, right?
Did you see that video? It was so bussin! Im cackling over here.  
My homie tried to pull off the ewokie move last night, but it didnt quite hit.  
Hvng a spill moment right nowlike, my brain is  in, but Im still crackin jokes.  
Ya feel me? The iykyk energy is real when youre in the zone.  
If you dont know what a lobotomy is, youre missing out on the biggest flex of all time.  
Spill season is here, and my DMs are lit af.  
Wanna trade? Ive got GOAT status on that gyatt energy.  
Sksksk, Im deadthis is too much for my brain to handle right now.

 Lets gen alpha this weekend for sure.  
 Im so vibing right now, cant even focus on anything else.  
Yo, thats such a sigma move, honestly. Like, who just decides to do something so basic?  
My friend tried to explain this sigma grindset theory to me, but I was too busy being Chungus and asking, What even is time?  
I heard the best lore ever about someone getting Sigmad and then disappearing forever.  
Bet you cant pull off a Chungus aesthetic in your dorm room right now.  
Stop being so Chungus with the DMs, like were not all trying to vibe in   
This story has some nextlevel lore, man. Like, did you know about the vamp behind it?
chungus energy levels are high rn im lit af  
Why u always an NPC when Im trying to be casual?

got to go before my energy tank dies. bye!  
why isnt my DMs popping like a Chungus? 
 I was like, pick me, but then they ghosted.
 Her drip was on point, though.
 We were lowkey trying to get into the vibe.
 The energy was so Chungus it hurt.
 He had bussin moves that I cant even describe.
 Her boggled response was so on point.
 I was lowkey just here for the content.
 The drip was strong, but I still had my own bussin stuff.
 Pick me when, though? Im always ready.
 It was all Chungus energy from start to finish.
 I was bussin it all night, but she was just lowkey observing.
 The drip was so intense, I couldnt help but pick me a piece of it.
 Its Chungus how sometimes you just have to go along with the vibe.
Ahhhhh, sheesh, youre literally killing me with your flex, like, Im out here trying to keep up with your extra levels of flyness. Bet youve been practicing in the mirror or something, yeah? The ick, seriously, how do you even? Like, how is it that you manage to be so cool while still being a literal baby? Babygirl, youre playing too hard for this. Im over here trying to be basic but also unique, but your energy is just like, levels upon levels of extra. Youre like, situationship goals, for real. Like, how does anyone even have time to date with you around? Hits different, though, hits so different! Like, if I could bottle your vibe, Id probably sell it or something, but I guess Ill just keep fawning over you from the sidelines.
sure heres some creative text containing the requested slang
uwd, im literally so over it, like, FOMO is real, but tbh, im just vibeing on my own terms now. maxxing is defs the way to go when youre trying to keep up with the trends. edge vibes are so lit right now, but dont get too carried away or ull miss out on the next big thing. my bestie said something wild about the GOAT being whatever, and im like, spill it, cuz i need to know whats hot in the streets. uwu is for when youre just being extra, but ill still hit ya with some big yikes if u diss the vibe.
im so over these TikTok trends already, like, who came up with FOMO? its so basic. maxxing is honestly just trying too hard. edge vibes are cool but theyll have you acting out of character. my bestie and i were vibin last night, and we decided the GOAT is whatever, right? but then she hit me with some uwu energy, and honestly, it was too much. big yikes for anyone who doesnt get the memo.
man, im just here to uwu my way through life, no FOMO, no GOAT, just pure maxxing. edge vibes are lit when youre living your truth, but dont let it consume you. my bestie said shes done with TikTok trends, like, ive got bigger fish to fry, and im honestly here for it. big yikes if u think otherwise.
I was flexing my High Key energy all day,crushing it at the mall with my crew.  
They were like,Youre so rizz, but I knew I had to level up my simp game for the hot new girl.  
The sigma vibes were strong in the group chatsomeone had to call it out before we lost respect.  
Extra much, thoughI heard you trying to shade me behind my back.  
My friends are always slipping with these viral terms, like gaslight when they know Im onto their schemes.  
Im not just anyone, Im the ultimate skibidi in this group.  
We ended up at the Skibidi toilet, laughing so hard we couldve been hospitalized from all the gaslighting.  
But hey, thats what friends are forpushing each other to be our best or worst selves.  
fanum tax bro, Im so vibin right now, this grindset is lit, glazing everything, eepy vibes only, skibidi toilet mode, drip goals, Im out!
Highkey, my guy was spitting facts earlier, chungus energy all day.  
My group chat was lit AF last night, but someone tried to gaslight the NPC into thinking they werent cool enough.  
Dont play with my bala, tho.  
Frfr, that was so lit.  
Im so highkey ready for the weekend.  
My guy was saying some wild stuff, but chungus, I had to mute him.  
NPC, for real? Thats just basic knowledge.  
Im literally an NPC in this friendship group.  
Bala, tho, why you always gotta be so extra?  
Glizzy, my bag got glizzy when I bought that new gear.  
That move was lit, but you tripping over the gaslighting though.
 Did you see those TikTok challenges? Theyre all just pookie now.
 I cant believe she got Ld by her own mom.
 This new trend is so ate, like, just too extra.
 Youre being too dramatic, like, delulu levels right there.
 I swear, my friends are always using ick to describe anything cute.
 Shes been acting so sigma lately, not giving anyone a chance.
 It was lit! Like, straightup pookie energy all night.
 Why is everyone saying ate when they clearly had fun?
 Hes always talking about his edge, but Im over it.
 My sis is out here saying delulu because she loves it too much.
 I dont get why people are so obsessed with iykyk right now.
 That move was pure sigma, no doubt about it.
 They added another filter? Thats just straightup pookie.
 She tried to play it cool but got Ld hard.
 This new slang is too much, like, ate already ruined 
 My crush is so sigma, wont give me the time of day.
 Ive been saying pookie nonstop, and my friends are not here for it.
 Shes always using ick to describe cute boys, so annoying!
 He claims to be edge but looks like he hasnt seen the light since 
 Why is everyone on TikTok losing their minds over delulu? Its just a phase.
 I was just mewing about how cute my new merch is, and my friends started clowning me for being too extra.  
 Youve got to stop with the Skibidi sounds I cant handle it!  
 Hes been so deadass lately, always talking about his babygirl vibes.  
 We were just sitting there clowning when my bro pulled up with the most periodictt energy.  
 SituationSHIP is real were not just friends, were like brosis.  
 Nah, Im too busy flexing on TikTok, trying to get that perioooodt vibe going.  
 I cant with you right now, youre giving me full clown energy!  
 Hes been out here mewing all season its cringe but I love him.  
 Our group chat is always on fire with the deadass facts and periodictt drama.  
 Youve got to stop with the Situationship talkmy feelings cant handle it!  
ohio, im literally just here to poodle around and slay leotards. did you hear sigma? no, actually, thats me being basic. ate all the cookies, but still gassed when someone called me pookie. Ohio, why is this always happening? its giving me life  yeah, because Im out here flexing my sigma levels. im either slayin or failing, and youre just here observing. ate way too much, but sigma is real. ohio, lets go gattis. gymrat emojis removed for processing speed its giving me all the feels, but honestly, im just here to poodle until someone slays my aesthetic. oh, and dont even get me started on how basic this is  straight up Ohio vibes.
 I was so bussin today, like I had to touch grass after work to even feel sane.  
 My coworkers are all NPC when they act like theyve got something figured out.  
 Let her cook the mealliterally and metaphorically, or else youll end up in Ohio without a map.  
 Dont let her gaslight you into thinking youre the crazy one Ive seen enough to know better.  
 Yeah, Im from Ohio, but thats not relevant here unless were stanning insert meme account.

 Every time I see someone say its giving, Im reminded that were all just living in this neverending TikTok algorithm.  
 GOAT energy is reallike, when someone nails a meme or a trend, its literally the highest level of existence.  
 My social media feed is filled with people walking like Leonardo DiCaprio and Im here for it because that walk is pure power.  
 Ohio is basically the new its giving because its just a flex of your personalitylike, you cant explain it, but you know when its happening.  
 Situationships are the modern love languagewere all out here shipping our friends to coupledom like its the next big thing after TikTok trends.

clownery at its core is just being unbothered while still spilling tea.  
situationships are like casual dating but with more awkwardness and less commitment.  
let them cook is basically the answer to any problem, whether its food or drama.  
mewing is when you pretend to be a cat but really youre just being cute in a weird way.  
pick me is like when youve been friendzoned but still hope you can get on that list again.  
betting on who can do more clownery is the ultimate trash talk challenge.

 Rizz is real, but can you handle it?  
 I ate that snack, and Im feeling so full.

 Gyatt, how could you not know about this?  
 Skibidi, skibidi, Im here for the vibe.  
 Im just trying to get a snack before the pookie gets eaten.  
 Her glazing was on pointso extra!
Im basically an NPC in this group chat can someone else take over?  
FOMO is real, but Ill catch up on sleep later.  
Just clowning with my friends before the party started.  
Trying to stay edgy but its not always easy.

 I was dying. The first one rolls their eyes dramatically, Ugh, so relatable. Im basically a pick me  
 The group giggles as they discuss viral sounds and dances, with one exclaiming, That slay in the video last night? Straight up iconic! 
 Someone brings up the latest challenge, saying, I tried the fanum tax where you have to buy followers, but I only have  and its so not worth it. 
 They all groan in unison. The conversation shifts to their own lives, with one saying, 
 My friend is basically a lore expertshe knows every single TikTok lingo and were all just living for it. 
 Another chimes in, Yeah, and if youre not paying attention, someones gonna hit you with a girlboss attitude and leave you in the dust.
  They all laugh, their phones buzzing with notifications as they continue to scroll.
i was lowkey flexing about my new kicks but kept it chill cause i didnt want to seem too much.  
shes basically a girlboss in every situation, always slaying and owning her life.

glazing through the comments like oh my god, this is so lit but still keeping it lowkey.  
we need to touch grass and reset because the energy in this group chat is wild.  
my friend keeps saying im just here to bussin and its so relatable.  
lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, but make it more like bogged af cause thats how I feel about school.  
dude, youre reading too much and need to touch grass immediately.  
 Thats so lowkey, but also highkey lit.
 Ugh, why is everything always Glazing?

 Lets touch grass after this, its been a long week.  
 Shes living her best edge life right now.  
 Skibidi, wheres my mukbang?  
 Babygirl energy is so strong in this group.  
 Thats such a flex, but also a cap move.  
 Im so over it, lets just spill the tea already.  
 This vibe is giving me major FOMO.  
 Youre literally the Chungus of this situation.  
 Cant believe how edge this playlist is.  
 Touch grass, take a deep breath, and lets get back to it.  
 Her Instagram captions are on another levelstraight up rizz.  
 Stop with the cap stories, were all adults here.

 Im so over this cap, cant even with it.  
 Lets spill all the tea because times a tickin.  
Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend? Im literally W every time someone tries to explain it to me. Eepy much, huh?

Skibidi toilet, my friend. Thats basically what everyones doing in their DMs these days. Bussin.  
Wanna know how I became a fanum tax? Just ask me about the latest viral sound effectewokie levels, though.
Hits different was all over my feed today, and honestly, I couldnt help but vibe to it. Like, that energy is unmatched. Gyatt for sure, thats such a vibe. My friends were cracking jokes about oomfie the other night, and I just couldnt stop laughing. Its so casual yet relatable. Bala though, Im still trying to figure out what exactly it means. Is it like a new slang term or just someones name? Either way, its catchy. We were talking about this whole Situationship thing too, and honestly, its the most meta thing ever. Just when you think youve got it figured out, life throws something else at you. Ate is all I can say. The world needs more of that energy. And while were at it, lets not forget about clout. Thats just facts. And fanum tax, oh man, thats the ultimate flex. You know what I mean? Just bringing in the bag and repping your own brand.
im literally bet for this TikTok challenge! have you seen the grimace shake video?  so delulu and frfr when youre trying to keep it cool but really not. my baddie status is on point though, no cap.  
youre telling me you havent seen not them yet?  bet your fave TikTokker is doing the L move in their next video. delulu energy is just too much sometimes, frfr.  
im not here for this bala trendwhen did it become cool to just stand there and do nothing but flex? my baddie aesthetic is strong AF though.

Let me tell you, this bussin is off the charts right now.  
When your girlboss level is unmatched, but youre still sneaky linking with your squad at  AMclassic Gen Z energy!  
The kai cenat trend? Yeah, thats been blowing up for a while now.  
Clowning in TikTok challenges? Oh, you havent seen anything until youve seen the latest viral videos.  
Sigma levels are high, but were all just trying to keep up with the fastpaced culture.  
Its like, lore is everywherewhether its in meme captions or casual conversation.  
You cant escape it, but thats what makes it so fun, right?  
The way we talk now is literally a whole new language.  
Stay bussin, stay sneaky, and keep cloutchasing because thats just how it goes.
The doggo had the audacity to gatekeep the snacks, so we had to ratio them out. 
Im not here for that lore, thougheveryone knows its all about the extra vibing. 
Ohio is literally the worst place for a ewokie hangover, but hey, maybe I should just let it eepy and move on.
 No one wants a gatekeeper like me, so Ill just keep my ratio on point. If anyone tries to play not them, theyre getting the fullbruh treatment.
My POV was always behind the scenes, watching everyone else have all the fun.  
She had the babygirl vibe down patalways knew exactly what to do or say.  
Hes just an NPC in my life, never adding anything meaningful to the conversation.  
The GOAT thing is real, like when she brought up that hidden talent for cooking.  
I was vibing hard on this new playlist, but it just wasnt hitting the right spots.  
Its not every day you meet your babygirl best friend who gets you like that.  
Her slay energy was contagious, always turning heads wherever we went.  
I gave her a sideways grimace shake because I couldnt handle her latest drama.  
If anyone needs a POV on the situation, its mealways in the know.
Skrilix Ugh, my mood is just off. Like, SpicyBoi was tryna hit me with lore, but Im still trying to get outta this fire zone.  
SpicyBoi Hey, dont sigma on me! If youre feeling highkey vibes, lets make it happen.  
Skrilix Alright, my bestie, lets get into this. Ive been seeing too many NPCs in my feed, and honestly, its giving me mood whiplash.  
SpicyBoi Yeah, that lore is extra sus. And dont even get me started on these sigma energy people. Theyre all like, Im over it, but then theyre back sliding into your DMs.  
Skrilix Exactly! We need to call out the NPCs for real. Theyre just going through the motions without any personality.  
SpicyBoi And the mood swings? Like, one second youre highkey vibing, next youre over it. Its so confusing.  
Skrilix True. But at least weve got each other to vent to. You my bestie, always.  
SpicyBoi Same, my Mewing queen. Lets keep the lore going and never let those NPCs get us down.  
Skrilix On it! Next fire challenge, were out.

 Did you hear about the new TikTok trend where people mew at their cats all day? So relatable.  
 Skibidi is officially my goto when I cant decide what to do nextjust vibes, man.  
 I tried pookieing it last night, and now Im hooked on anything with that sound.  
 Edge cases are the best, right? Like when you cant stop thinking about a viral meme.  
 Sigma energy is the secret to getting through a long dayjust know your worth!  
 Touch grass, bro. You need to ground yourself sometimes, or else youll lose it.  
 Bussin in the kitchen last night, made some bomb recipes that no one can forget.  
 Ayo, my drip is so fresh, you gotta see it.
 We were vibin in the kitchen, and then Name came in spilling cereal everywhere.
 Touch grass, man! Youve been cooped up for days, your besties wondering why youre MIA.
 I told him to simp, but he just kept eating chips outta the bag.
Ugh, my friend keeps talking about big yikes whenever something wild happens. Did you see that video where they did the grimace shake during the live? So extra, right?  
I heard about this new slang called delulu. Its like when someone is being so dramatic online, and their friends just laugh and say lore because its so cringe.  
My cousin tried to explain fanum tax to me, but I was too busy thinking they were just trying to sound cool. Anyway, I ended up looking it up later.
Im Pookie, like, spilling all the tea about how my crush sent me sending me vibes but then ghosted me. Im still over here trying to figure out why hes so sigma, probably because hes scared of getting caught with his secret rizz game. Anyway, lets talk about that TikTok challenge where you have to say spill every time someone mentions their pets namemy cat is named Whiskers, but shes all about the ick.  
Let me rizz you with some facts I once tried to explain my love for skibidi toilet memes, and no one believed me until I showed them the viral video. But now theyre all like, Oh, you were right, which is kind of satisfying but also a bit cringe. And if someone ever tries to throw shade at my sigma level, Im gonna be like, You wish, because I know the moves.  
The ick is real, though. My friend tried to explain TikTok slang to her parents, and they were just like, What? So, yeah, were all trying to keep this culture alive before it gets too old. But if you ever see me spilling tea about someone else, know that Im just cooking up some factsliterally.  
Let him cook, literally. My brother once said that to my mom, and she was like, What? But now were all in on the chaos. So, yeah, keep sending me, because this brainrot is real, but its also kinda lit.
 I was just clowning with my friends earlier, but then they started talking about serious stuff.
 Shes been gaslighting me all day with her antics.
 This new TikTok trend is so grimy, I cant even handle it.
 He came up with the biggest yikes when we tried to plan our next move.
 Im trying to get into this new lore about influencers, but its so confusing.
 We were just mewing over this viral video thats taking over the internet.
 Its giving me all the big yikes every time I scroll through my feed.
I cant include quotation marks or emojis, but I can provide some creative text chunks using the words youve mentioned  
 Snatched energy is when someones vibe is so strong you just know theyre a main character.  
 Zaza, thats the vibe Im sending.  
 High key, my grindset has been on fleek all season.  
 Situationships are the most lowkey but also the most snatched.  
 Eepy stuff always comes out of nowhere.  
 Delulu, dont play.  
 Grindset is real when youre cooped up but still slugging through.  
my friends always ask me for my pov on things we watch together.  
she was just vibing to some music when i asked her about it.  
hes got so much main character energy, you cant help but love him.  
that was such an ick moment when...  
i couldnt help but say ick when i saw that.  
yeah, same, iykyk, cant even handle it.  
we were all vibing in the car when he brought up the idea.  
you know when youre just in that zone of main character energy?  
this vibe is so strong, im just here vibing and cosigning everything.
 He was really boggled when his friend told him about the new TikTok trend.
 Deadass, you know what happened?
 Im literally about to die because of this Edge situation.
 Shes been gatekeeping about the inside info all along.
 Thats such a Chungus move, though.
 Hes been sigma lately, acting like he knows everything.
 Youre just being too extra with the gyatt energy.
 I cant believe you still use Edge instead of the cool stuff.
 Shes always bringing up deadass facts that no one cares about.
 Im so over this sigma energy in our group chat.
 Sneaky link for the win!  
 Whats your ratio?  
 Shes always trying to give me the sneaky link to stuff that isnt even good.  
 When they say not them, but clearly they are.  
 Im sorry, did you think a baddie wouldnt spill the tea?  
 Oh, youre one of those people whos always maxxing.  
 That spill was fire, honestly.  
 Why are you acting like that wasnt a skibidi?  
 Im not trying to be your main character, okay?  
 Honestly, the way theyre maxxing is giving me life.  
 If youve got a sneaky link, lets go!  
 Who even tries to use ratio as a serious metric anymore?  
 Not them energy is lowkey my spirit animal.  
 Im so tired of people who cant stop with the spill.  
 Shes claiming her baddie status, but I know the truth.  
 Youre not the only one maxxinglets see it!  
 That sneaky link led me to the best TikTok viral moment ever.  
 If youre here trying to ratio my life, Im not interested.  
 Honestly, when someone says not them, Im like who else could they possibly be?  
 The amount of times Ive been on a spill is honestly embarrassing.  
This dataset should help train your model on natural, conversational usage of TikTok slang!
Chungus energy is so strong today.  
Zaza, that was lit!  
Let her cook and find out.  
Skibidi season is here.  
Gatekeep your expectations low.  
Ewokie, you got this.  
Iykyk, the vibe is right.
Yeah, shes just be so extra at the store, grabbing up all those trendy merch and not caring whos watching. Vampy energy though, shes out here slayin. GYATT mode is onnnn, shes out here slayin with her friends. Oppenheimer style, theyre lighting it up in the DMs like wildfire. Sigma energy for sure, always knowing how to level up.

Im just here vibing, you know? Like, chilling with my homies and stuff. Were out here being extra, cause why not? Im in my Sigma zone right now, cruising through the day with no worries. Maybe Ill hit up my Babygirl later, send her a glizzy or something wild. Dont want to rizz too hard, thoughstill got some mewing to do. Honestly, lifes a clowning show sometimes, and Im just along for the ride.
My outfit was lit, everyone was asking where I got it from.  
The wings were vibe, but the fries were extra.  
Ugh, why is FOMO so real right now?  
Did you see that TikTok?  
Im feeling like a Babygirl today, so extra.  
We need to do it for the plot, for sure.  
Ratio or go home, honestly.  
Cant believe they deleted the video, who asked for a lobotomy?  
If youre not droppin, youre not doing it right.  
Its so hard to find a ratio these days.  
FOMO is real, but Im over it.  
I bet they didnt think about fanum tax when they made this.
Did you see how she mewed last night? That was so bussin. She had me cracking up with her be so fr energy. Honestly, Im still recovering from the GOAT status she threw on herself. Cant believe anyone could be that lit.
Remember when we were trying to figure out if lobotomy was a real word or just some meme? Now, its basically our goto term for when someone acts like theyve had their brain surgically altered to only think in TikTok terms.
Im over here just trying to be so fr about my life, but honestly, seeing the GOAT in action makes me feel like Im living in a simulation. Like, how can one person be so bussin at all times?
Did you know that NPC is now our term for anyone who doesnt understand the brainrot slang? Its wild how its become a whole new language. 
Im sorry, but if someone mewed in my presence and didnt immediately make me feel like I was living in a world where the GOAT existed, then they cant be trusted. Just saying.

 Ohio or nah? Honestly, the midwest has its own vibe.  
 Its giving me life, but also, like, Im dead inside.  
 Cant believe the glazing on this steakits fire!  
 Gen alpha thinks they invented the internet, though.  
 Clownery levels are high when you pull off a viral TikTok.  
 Mewing about how cute babies are? Basic, but cant hate it.  
 Chungus or not? Depends on the flex level.  
 Its giving me everything, except my sleep schedule.  
 Glazing it upliterally, like grilling with flair.  
 Kai cenat and vibe on point? Unbothered.  
 Ohio nights are wild, but also, wheres the slushie?

 Mewing over aesthetics until my eyes bleed.  
 Chungus energy when youre just here for the vibes.  
 Its giving me everything, but also, its a bit too much.

 Kai cenat like, Im wild, yeah, thats the vibe.  
 Ohio or nah? Depends on your vibe.
Yo, did you see her ratio? Shes just out here spilling vibes like its no big deal.  
Im so over this NPC energy. Like, cant we all just vibe without the extra drama?  
Be so fr when your friend asks you to pick me up, but youre lowkey in NPc mode.  
Everyones hitting different, but Im just here trying to keep my clout clean.

I was ratioing her stories, and she hit different with that aesthetic.  
Be so fr when youre trying to flex your lit life, but its just vibechecking over here.  
NPC mode activated when someone starts talking about their mood like its a crisis.  
Shes out here spilling vibes, but Im just over this extra.  
Fanum Tax for sure when youre trying to keep your lit life on point.  
Im so done with the ratio. Like, cant we all vibe without comparing?
 OMG, did you see that Ohio? My ex was basic, but this is straightup delulu.
 She was like, Hits different, and I was like, Yeah, because her Mewing is on point!
 I told my Sigma friend, and she was like, Slay or nah?
 The vibe was litdefinitely not basic, more like Mewing level.
 When someone says Sigma, its either a compliment or a slight roast, depending on context.
 My friends and I were so into this new trend called Skibidi that we decided to start our own group chat about it.
 This is lit, I said, using Ohio as code for something epic happening.
 She had the Mewing heard round the clockno cap.
 We were all like, Slay or nah? and honestly, anyone who says no is probably delulu.
 The energy was off the chartsI was living in my Hits different moment.

   My friends were like, Youre just caping it all up! But I didnt care, I was owning it.

Like, touch grass moments are scarce these days. I was vibing earlier, thinking about how gyatt is literally the vibe of my life right now. Frfr, its like the universe is just throwing everything at me and Im just over here trying to keep up. Kai, this is wild!

Leonardo DiCaprio walking into a room? Yeah, hits different.  
Like, L, are you serious right now?
My friend tried to explain TikTok trends to me, but all I could think about was how sus her main character energy was.  
I was vibing and then I just ate all the chips because why not?  
The group chat was so liteveryone was boggled by how cool the last viral meme was.  
Let them cook, I thought as my friend prattled on about something unimportant.  
I ate too much pasta, I groaned, but honestly, I was living for those carbs.  
The TikTok algorithm is just sus, right? It knows what we want before we do.  
I was so wasted from last nights brainrot that I could barely string a sentence together.  
Fanum tax? my friend asked, and I knew they were trying to trip me.  
The energy in the chat was pure main character vibeseveryone was shining.  
Im still boggled by how quickly TikTok trends come and go like forgotten memés.  
Let them cook, I told myself as I scrolled through another endless feed of content.  
Are you sus or not? someone asked, and I just nodded because obviously, I was.  
Theewwwwww, I thought as I saw an ewokie in the commentsit was too much.  
I ate a whole bag of popcorn while watching the latest TikTok drama unfold.  
The chat was liteveryone was vibing, main character energy flowing freely.  
Why is it always fanum tax when I try to be casual with my crush?  
Im so wasted, I muttered, but honestly, brainrot had me feeling alive.  
The algorithm is susit knows what we want before we even ask.  
I cant believe my crush called me an ewokie for not liking Star Wars.  
Let them cook, I thought as the group chat kept going off with endless memes.  
I ate too many snacks, I said to no one, because why not?  
The main character energy was high, but the sus vibes were even higher.  
Boggled doesnt even cover how confused I am about this TikTok drama.  
Let them cook, I told myself again, because patience is a virtue or something.  
My friend kept saying fanum tax until I literally had to ask what it meant.  
The chat was litvibes were strong, and the energy was off the charts.  
I ate a whole pizza while scrolling through TikToks endless brainrot feed.  
Are you sus or not? someone asked, and I just said Sus, of course.  
The algorithm is susit knows what we want before we even type a search.  
TikTok trends come and go like forgotten memés, and honestly, its wild.  
I was vibing in the park when my friend hit me with a main character energy check.  
Boggled doesnt cover how I felt when I saw the latest TikTok drama unfold.  
Let them cook, I thought as I waited for the next viral meme to drop.  
I ate too much, I said to no one because brainrot had me forgetting my own name.  
The chat was liteverybody was sus, vibing, and living their best life.  
Fanum tax is real, and honestly, Im just here for the chaos of it all.

Let me ask you, are we gonna let them cook or nah?  
Yo, thats some nextlevel rizz, for real.  
Ohio representing hard with the swag vibes.  
Cant even front about it, its just too fire.
Yo, that baddie energy is so strong right now, where you getting it from?
Did your friend ever explain the oomfie thing? Im still lost.
I cant stop laughing at how eepy people are being these days.
Couldnt believe the viral Glazing trend its everywhere!
FOMO is no joke, like Im always missing out on the cool stuff.
That Ohio reference had me rolling for hours.
Shes got such a vamp aesthetic in her Insta stories.
The skibidi toilet video has to be seen to believe.
Did you see how zaza was just mellowing about gen alpha? I bet shes been grinding that lore nonstop. Grindset much? Pick me already!  No, seriously, mewing over those bet vibes is not cute. Delulu much? Bet youre still on that grindset. Zaza, though, shes out here like, pick me, pick me! Im not gen alpha, but I can feel the lore in the air. Grindset and zaza together? Mewing for sure. Bet you cant handle this delulu level. Pick me, pick me!

deadass tried to rizz me again with that weak af game, but im not having it.  
chungus was at the party, grinning like he invented the grimace shake.  
i was just about to sigma grindset when my clout got ruined by a skibidi toilet situation.  
pov when you ask for chicken and they give you a ketchup dip instead of sauce.  
deadass thought he could rizz the teacher, but she was having none of it.  
my homie was flexing his sigma grindset, but i knew he wasnt really that lit.  
they say clout is everything, but im over it like a skibidi toilet.  
pov when youre trying to rizz and your brain just wont let you keep up.  
chungus was vibing in the car, doing the grimace shake to the beat.  
deadass didnt know what hit him when his sigma grindset backfired.  
my friends are always talking about their clout, but its getting old, honestly.  
pov when youre trying to be cool and end up looking like a deadass fool.
 I was vibing when she said say sike rn, and we ended up crashing the party.
 Hes been pressing about starting a new project but seems unsure about his commitment.
 Shes been delulu about her new hobby, talking about it nonstop.
 Weve been in this situahtivity for months without a clear direction.
 Pressing has become a term Im learning to understand better, often meaning urgency.
 My friend mentioned hits different when describing her date last night.
 She introduced fanum tax and left without explaining it, leaving me curious.
hits different though  
clout flexing hard today  
its giving major vibes  
lowkey flexing on my friend but dont tell anyone

you know what I mean?
Yo, I was just scrolling through TikTok and saw this viral Lore video. It was so cringe but also kind of hilarious, you know? Like, where did they even find these people? Anyway, moving on, I heard someone got ghosted by their own shadow in a TikTok challenge. Thats wild, right? And dont get me started on the iykyk trendeveryones using it, but honestly, its getting old. Im over it. Plus, clowning is everywhere now. Like, every other video is some kid trying to be the next big thing. But hey, at least it keeps the content fresh, even if its a bit exhausting. Anyway, catch you later.
Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend? Its all about being a stan for your fave influencer. Im definitely a stan for that one girl who makes meme compilationsbig yikes, shes just too lit.
I heard someone got ratiod hard after trying to start a viral trend. But then again, it didnt really take off because people were like, Thats clownery.
NPCs are everywhere these days. My cousin was talking about how his friend is an NPC in a relationshiplike, literally just a background character.
Some people are so focused on being edgy that they forget what actual fun is. Like, when someone pulls out the Fanum Tax line and nobody knows what it meansbut they say it anyway, and we all laugh anyway.
Sirmaam, Im  and still love One Direction. Dont judge me. Also, if you think lore is just about video games, then youre missing out on the real memes.
Lets vamp this convostraight up GOAT energy vibes!  
Their ratio is on another level, no cap.  
Did you see that glazing? It was lit AF, period.

Vamp this, then fade out.  
No cap, thats the move.  
Keep it up, and dont stop glazing.  
Oppenheimer stylenext level flex.
Hey, did you hear about that new TikTok trend where people are calling everything GOAT or W? Like, if someone asks for Directions and you respond with Doog instead of Dog, theyre probably gonna rizz so hard. Speaking of rizz, I saw this video where the person literally just said SirMaam to their pet cat, and it was pure lore. Ewokie levels are high right now, honestly. Like, when someone refers to their crush as lore, you know theyre  into it. And dont even get me started on Mewingthats straightup G.O.A.T. status.
Yo, that NPC move was so extra! You really went full Pookie on that.  
Btw, dont even try to rizz me with that stuff. I see right through it.  
Whats up? Did you just become a High Key? Youre acting like a whole new person.  
Cloutwise, that move was lit! But honestly, its not going to get you far.  
Are you always this basic with the slang? Just clout and rizz?  
NPCs are everywhere these days. Theyre basically the background noise of social media.  
You shouldve seen my friend try to ratio someone the other daypure chaos!  
Whats with everyone being so W? Is it  or did I miss something?  
Guys, stop with the Ls already. One more and youre getting reported.  
Do you think using Pookie on your own friend is cool? Hard no.  
High Key energy is one thing, but fullon cloutchasing is just cringe.  
Yo, if youre not here to ratio, dont even waste my time.  
NPCs are like the background music of TikTokconstantly there but nobody really listens.  
You cant just throw out a rizz and expect it to land. Some of us have selfrespect!  
Whats with W being the goto insult now? Its getting so tired.  
Calling someone a Pookie is the ultimate backhanded compliment these days.  
If youre not here to clout, why are you even on the app?  
High Key or not, some moves are just straightup sus.  
Do you think using ratio as slang is original? Its been done a million times!  
NPCs are basically walking meme factories these days. Theyre too easy to meme.  
You cant halfrizz and expect it to work. Either go all in or dont do it at all.  
Are we still on the W kick? Its getting old, fast.  
Calling someone a Pookie is like calling them a fan favoritesure, but with a twist.  
High Key energy or not, you cant just waltz into a conversation and drop a clout reference without context.  
NPCs are the unsung heroes of TikTok. They keep the content flowing but never get the spotlight.  
Youre either all in on the rizz or youre not. Theres no halfway.  
Do you think using ratio is still cool? It feels so   
High Key moves are cool, but they dont change the fact that youre still just a person.  
NPCs might be the most relatable thing about TikTok right now.  
You cant halfclout and expect people to take you seriously. Its an allornothing situation.  
Whats with W being the default insult for anyone who doesnt meet your standards?  
Calling someone a Pookie is like saying theyre a fanfavorite, but in a bad way.  
If youre not here to ratio, why are you even on TikTok? Lets be real.  
High Key or not, some moves are just too extra for this generation.  
Do you think using rizz is still a thing? Its starting to sound dated.  
NPCs are the ultimate flexible friendstheyre always down but never ask for much in return.  
You cant halfclout and expect it to count. Go big or stay quiet.  
Whats with W being the goto for anyone who doesnt fit your vibe? Its so basic.  
Calling someone a Pookie is like calling them your favorite, but in a weird way.  
If youre not here to ratio, maybe its time to log off and find some real friends.  
High Key or not, we all know the difference between trying too hard and just being yourself.  
NPCs are basically TikToks version of background charactersthey exist but rarely speak.  
You cant halfrizz and still expect credit. Its an allornothing kind of thing.  
Whats with W becoming the insult du jour? Its getting repetitive, honestly.
When I told my friends about the spill in the kitchen, they went wild with questions. He kept doing this grimace shake whenever we talked about his crush, but I didnt say anything. We ended up skibidiing around town, checking out all the cool spots. Shes been vibing so hard lately, always on her phone or hanging with friends. His clothes were so grimy from days at the park, but he didnt seem to care. I sent him a text, sending me some new memes that were just too good. He kept deluluing about how much fun we had, but I knew his heart was in the right place.
bussin af, glazing on everything, ohioaaaaa, hits different bruh, gatekeep my name outta ur mouth, salty as heck, zaza, leonardo dicaprio walking through the mall, yeah, thats so bussin, someone said.  
i was like, ohio for sure, and we started comparing the slaps in our feed, hits different, right? but then she gatekept me with her aesthetic. i was salty af, honestly. zaza tho, she kept saying it nonstop, making me feel like i was walking through a glazing moment or something.  
leonardo dicaprio walking is straight iconic, like his energy, you know? and yeah, we ended up bussin over the snacks later, cause that hits different.
