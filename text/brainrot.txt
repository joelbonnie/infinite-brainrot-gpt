That NPC at the party kept glazing over my fit like a total skibidi fanboy. Meanwhile my pookie tried to fanum tax my bussin fries but I was eepy from vamping all night. Ohio behavior fr.  

Sis brought up her situationship again—babygirl stay delulu thinking he’s got W rizz. He said luh cozy night in then hit her with the meh energy. Pressing for clout or nah.  

Skibidi toilet edits slay harder than sigma gym bros yelling gyatt during deadlifts. Rizzlers in the chat keep glazing my takes but I’m just here for the vibes.  

Tried to explain fanum tax to my math teacher. She called it Ohio calculus. My rizz? Delulu. Now I’m eepy from vamping till 3am watching skibidi compilations.  

Spotted a sigma reading Nietzsche at Starbucks. His W rizz had me gyatt-ing discreetly till my pookie dragged me out. NPCs in line were glazing his drip.  

Babygirl brought bussin cookies then hit us with the fanum tax mid-bite. Now she’s delulu claiming situationship with the barista. Ohio Friday nights smh.  

My luh meh mood vanished when my situationship sent a skibidi meme. Now I’m glazing his texts like a rizzler. Vamped my fit just to NPC at the park.  

Gen Alpha slang tier list: Gyatt (S-tier). Eepy (vamped to classics). Ohio (overused but slays). Delulu (bussin self-roast). NPCs stay pressing for sigma status.  

Overheard a sigma dissing skibidi humor. Bro’s W rizz is a glazing masterclass. Meanwhile I’m eepy from fanum-taxing my roommate’s ramen. Ohio vibes only.  

Pookie’s new situationship has NPC energy—zero rizz, all meh. Tried glazing her luh makeup look but she’s too delulu simping for sigma TikTokers.  

Vamped my nails metallic while debating if Ohio chili deserves the skibidi hype. My rizzler era begins when the fanum tax hits. Babygirl, pass the hot sauce.  

Mid-convo he dropped the gyatt Ohio meme. I cackled—total W rizz maneuver. Now my pookie’s glazing his sigma aura. Delulu hive stay winning.  

Eepy after fanum-taxing my sibling’s slay-worthy fries. Tried to sigma grind but ended up NPC-scrolling skibidi edits. Rizz? None. Vibes? Ohio-core.  

Glazing my luh plant collection when my situationship hit me with the skibidi sound. Now we’re eepy-vamping for a 2am W rizz Ohio road trip. Babygirl’s delulu agenda: activated.Bro tried to hit the Fanum Style in Skibidi Ohio and ended up paying the Fanum Tax twice. Womp womp, his rizz was bloat fr. Pookie got that gyatt on fleek, no cap. Slay, babygirl, slay! Ong, them fries are bussin but where the luh sauce at?  

Caught my mans glazing over that sigma NPC like he’s him. Bro’s on edge, babygirl, chill before you get hit with the bloat. Yo, that skibidi fan edit got me weak—why he edge so hard for a mid take? Womp womp moment.  

Erm… you call that rizz? Fanum tax came for bro’s whole vibe. Now he’s out here looking like a skibidi NPC. Still, gotta respect the grind—dude’s him when he’s not stuck in Ohio mode. Pass the luh glizzy, this babygirl’s starving.  

Sigma behavior unlocked: ignored the Fanum Tax, pulled up with unspoken rizz, and glazed his own haters. Ong, the gyatt on that bloat meme had me crying. Womp womp to the NPCs still stuck in 2023.  

Skibidi pasta challenge? Nah, bro’s out here doing the Fanum Style meal prep. Edging closer to cringe every day but slaying hard. Babygirl called him a NPC and now he’s on luh mode. L for glazing, W for sigma energy.  

Who let him cook? Tried to flex rizz but paid the Fanum Tax in front of gyatt nation. Now he’s Ohio-pilled, doing skibidi glazing for clout. Womp womp, take the L and log off, my guy.  

Pookie’s unhinged sigma arc went too far. Started edging haters, ended up a babygirl NPC. Still, that skibidi dance move? Bussin. Ong, Ohio really breeds the himbos. Fanum Tax collectors at the door, tho.  

Erm… this bloat take is giving NPC. RiZZless behavior, my guy. Hit the Fanum Style gym and come back when that gyatt’s slaying. Womp womp ain’t the vibe. Babygirl deserves better.  

Glazing over Ohio memes while ignoring the sigma grind? Luh bloat activities. Bro’s him when he’s not stuck in skibidi mode. Pass the bussin sauce, this Fanum Tax got me starving.  

Sigma protocol: evade Fanum Tax, rizz the gyatt, slay the skibidi haters. NPCs stay edging, babygirl stays fed. Ong, him energy is unmatched. Womp womp to the bloaters still stuck in the luh leagues.

Saw a sigma on my FYP flexing his drip while mewing in Ohio. Deadass thought it was a NPC until he pulled out the rizz and started spitting facts. Let him cook but low-key sus he’s glazing himself.  

Spill the tea: my blehh ex tried to slide into my sneaky link’s DMs with that skibidi gyat energy. Called them out and they ghosted—big yikes. Now I’m in my main character era, unbothered and slaying.  

POV: Fanum tax hits different when your baddie roommate takes the last Bussin’ snack. TFW you’re ready to clap back but she hits you with the ocky way smirk. Zero chill, fam.  

Stan Twitter is wild rn—some CEO of cringe posted a delulu edit of their fave and it’s giving cheugy. Comments are all cap like yaaas king but the vibe is mid AF.  

Tried GRWM for a situationship date, but my Finsta oomf leaked the fit. Now the group chat’s throwing shade saying I’m in my flop era. JOMO activated—staying home to vibe with my zodiac and yeet that L.  

NPC at the party kept glazing over the sigma’s fire rizz. Meanwhile, me and my QT sneaky link were spilling tea about his NPC energy. Whole thing was a certified W until someone mentioned Ohio—mood ruined.  

My toxic trait? Thinking every viral hit CEO of rizz wants me. Sis said stop glazing and touch grass, but I’m delulu hundo P. Praying the algorithm blesses my glow up.  

Fanum tax level: stealing your bestie’s Gucci eyeliner because hers is on fleek. She caught me and now I’m canceled—spill the tea or keep it tight? Choices.  

That skibidi trend is straight bussin but low-key mid if you’re not a sigma. Saw a boomer try it on my FYP and almost died. Comments were like dank cringe, let him cook tho.  

Ghosted by my situationship but found their Finsta full of thirst traps. TFW you’re jelly but your friends scream waste—time to glow up and find a king who’s hundo P based.  

Edge lord in my DMs trying to rizz me up with NPC-tier lines. Hit him with the blehh and blocked. Big yikes energy, zero drip. Stan a queen who knows her worth.  

Spilled tea about my ex’s flop era and now their crew’s clapping back. IDGAF—my vibe’s snatched, and I’m living for the drama. Canceled? More like finally free.  

Sis said my OOTD is giving cheugy but I’m like nah, it’s Y2K fire. Posted it anyway—let the stans debate. Either way, FYP gonna eat it up. Main character energy, periodt.  

Mood: Listening to a viral hit while low-key shipping my two oomfs. Their tension? Spicier than a sneaky link’s texts. Someone spill the tea before I manifest a situationship.  

TFW you’re trying to mew in peace but your sibling bursts in yelling skibidi Ohio. Can’t even. Ghosted their vibe and threw shade via Finsta. Zero regrets—it’s a W for mental health.

skibidi toilet trends have me in a chokehold lowkey but no cap the way that fanum tax hit my plate last night was unhinged gyatt dayum did you see her osama bin swagging through the cafeteria like a sigma rizzlord the baby Gronk vibe at the party had everyone in their glizzifying era fr fr im so skibidi-pilled i can’t even Ohio my way out of this L situation she’s so mewing coded with that sussy grimace shake energy bro tried to edge me with mid rizz but i’m in my slay era periodt the way that NPC just orange pilled the whole chat is sending me we’re so back in the bussin timeskip arc

I was just vibe checking my friends and realized they were all lowkey flexing without even knowing it.

She’s been spilling the tea about everyone in our group chat, but honestly, no cap, she keeps it real.  

He’s got such big energy that you can’t help but feel lit every time he walks in the room. 

I was trying to vibe shift during the Zoom meeting, but my boss caught on and said, 'Keep it professional.'  

After leveling up in the app, I’m finally able to plug in some trends and make moves.

They say I’m extra, but honestly, if you don’t know, you’re just not unbothered enough.  

I was flexing my skills at the Renegade challenge, and tbh, I got it going viral.

The mood was on fleek, and we all knew it was going to be a legend night.

She’s been sponging all the hot takes in our group chat, but she’s also got some facts to drop.

I told them I’d plug it in during the next meeting, and now they’re all asking for more.

No cap, this was one of those moments where you just had to say 'for sure' to keep the energy up.  

His ‘big energy’ is unmatched—lit af, always ready to spill the tea.

I’m trying to vibe check these trends, but honestly, I’m still figuring out what’s for sure going viral.

She’s unbothered AF and always got level up content to share.

The group chat was lit when we started fact-checking each other’s claims—no cap, it was hilarious.

The vibe was lit because the aesthetic was on fleek and everyone was spilling the tea about the mood over Miami.  

I felt FOMO when coomer culture started taking over, but then I realized it was just the plot twist nobody saw coming.  

Wholesome energy was everywhere, and the icon of the group had a vibe check that left everyone unbothered.  

Sounds only on TikTok played a major role in my feels, making me question if I was missing something or if it was just a mood over Miami situation.  

Goals were being thrown left and right, but I knew I had to keep up with the aesthetic or get left behind.  

Aura was thick, and I could feel the energy shifting as people started spilling the tea about what really happened behind closed doors.  

The vibes were checked constantly, and if you weren’t unbothered, you know the coomer vibes would come for you.  

I was flexing my wholesome card hard, but deep down, I knew I was just living rent-free in my own brainrot.

Walking past the gyatt parked at the gas station, my sneaky link texted saying keep it lowkey but bring that zaza. I told him NPC behavior fr but still slid through after mewing in the mirror to boost my sigma rizz.  

Fanum tax hit hard when Jake tried snatching my glizzy at the cookout. Everyone yelled L move bro while I secured the W by hiding the bussin mac and cheese.  

Her lore’s wild—went from delulu over a situationship to full baddie mode after vamping her style. Now she’s ice cold, dropping iykyk hints about her sigma grindset.  

TikTok’s skibidi edits got me bogged. Comments like slay or Ohio but fr tho that Ewokie filter’s bala. My oomfie said it’s giving big chungus energy and I can’t unsee it.  

Tried the gyatt workout trend—10/10 regret. Couldn’t even rizz up my gym crush ’cause I was too busy glazing over her edge. She side-eyed me like yikes L take.  

Drip too icy? More like grimy. Forgot my sneaky link’s scenarioship rules and showed up reeking of zaza. He said ewokie vibes and ghosted. Now I’m NPC-coding my texts to revive the rizz.  

Sigma tip: skip babygirl-ing your ex. Hit the skibidi shuffle, tax Fanum’s fries, and let the gyatt-maxi-primal-grindset-lore do the work. Glizzy gladiators stay winning.

Bro tried to hit on her at the party but his rizz was glitching when she mentioned Fanum Tax—dude got so pressed he started glazing her Sigma tendencies like an NPC. Meanwhile my pookie over here dropping skibidi lore like Ohio is the new edge capital.  

That delulu siren from math class keeps yelling gyatt every time someone bussin a move near the vending machine. Babygirl thinks she’s him but honestly the situationship energy is balah levels of cringe.  

Spotted a blorbo at the café today wearing a sigma grindset shirt while whispering skibidi rizz to his phone. Tried to Fanum Tax his fries but he hit me with the Ohio stare—full glazing no cap.  

Why’s my sibling pressing about my lore like they’re NPCs stuck in a siren side quest? I’m just here for the bussin memes and the occasional him/her debate. Stay delulu pookie.  

Her skibidi impression went full gyatt mode during the Zoom call and now HR’s edge lore includes a chapter on why Fanum Tax applies to office snacks. Babygirl out here rizzing the corporate glazers.  

Dude brought a balah to the gym screaming sigma rizz while doing curls. The locker room lore now says Ohio siren vibes got him pressing weights like NPCs in a glazing simulator.  

Pookie’s new situationship is peak delulu—they quoted skibidi ballads over tacos then tried to Fanum Tax my last chip. Called them out and they hit the him/her pose like a sigma avoiding edge duty.  

Caught my blorbo glazing their reflection whispering sigma affirmations. Tossed a skibidi remix their way and now they’re pressing me about Ohio-tier rizz. Fanum Tax this energy please.

slay queen, you’re literally so extra right now, rizz-ing left and right like you’ve never rizzed before. 

Is this your first sigma grindset or what? I’m honestly here for the drama, it’s giving me life. 

Babygirl, you’re just sitting there with your glizzy on full display, and honestly, it’s not fair to the rest of us. 

The way you’re vibing in that situationship is just too much. 

Iykyk, it’s hard not to stan for this energy.

What’s good? Oh my gosh, you’re so w, like literally nobody. This is giving me some serious bogged vibes, but in the best way possible. 
 
I’m here for the chaos, honestly. Keep rizzing and slaying, we’re all living for it.

Yo, that was such a slay performance last night—so clutch and fire! Did you see how he rizzed the crowd? Honestly, some people just have this sigma glow, like they're lit AF and nobody can touch them.

I’m all about this vibe, especially when it’s extra grimy and ice cold. W, though, that move was straight up L—no shade, but honestly, we all know it sometimes happens. 

Let’s keep it real and stay on our grind, flexing that sigma energy daily. If you’re not into the whole situation, just let it go—iykyk, right? 

We’re all here for the drama, and if you’re not, then you’re missing out on some major edge cases.

Don’t forget to keep it baddie tight and stay humble because, in this game, we’re all trying to level up. So, keep pushing your limits and never settle—this is just the beginning of the grindset!

"Hey, did you see that guy? He was slayin' with his babygirl vibes so hard, it was like rizzing all day long. 

But then he mentioned his 'sigma grindset,' and I was like, 'Yo, you already hit that.'

We ended up at the local skibidi spot, crunching on those OG chips while he kept spitting facts about his Ohio roots.

NPC levels were high, but honestly, his edge was so sharp, it was giving me whiplash. 

You know what I mean? Like, 'This guy's got a grimy style, ice cold, straight up.' W, are you with me or what? Let's get this glizzy poppin'. 

And don't even get me started on the bala Energy drinks—he had them stacked like it was some kind of flex. 

Bogged AF, man. But then again, when he said 'I'm here for the lore,' I was like, 'Bro, you got the vapors, straight up.' 

Delulu much? And his attempt at being a 'baddie'—yeah, he had that W, no doubt. Zaza vibes were strong, and I wasn't even mad about it.

Situationship? Nah, this guy was living it—iykyk, hard pass."

My bussin' NPC is always bringing the energy!

She totally slay her look last night with that outfit.  
He tried to rizz her but she was having none of it.  
The gym is lit, I can feel the vibe—so much gyatt energy!  
You know what? I’m just here for the sigma grindset.  
The fanum tax is real, you can’t escape it.  
My Ohio pride is strong—I’d defend it to the end.  
She’s got such an edge, I can see why she’s a babygirl.  
Lore or die—there’s no in-between!  
You’re honestly just being delulu if you think otherwise.  
 That move was straight-up bussin!  

"Yo, did you see that 'gyatt' video? That was straight up lit."  
"The way she 'rizzed' me in front of everyone? I was like, 'W, this is my new baddie.'"  
"She kept saying 'bogged,' but I was the one who ended up sliding into her DMs. Hard no."  
"My homie tried to hit on me with some corny 'delulu' lines—nope, not gonna work."

"She's all about that 'babygirl' energy, always looking like a snack and acting extra."  
"The way they were vibing in the 'edge' zone was pure gold—no cap."  
"I was feeling so 'oomfie,' I couldn't stop staring at her, but she ended up hitting my DMs first."

You got some serious sigma energy today.

I'm not paying the fanum tax anymore.

"yo, did you see that video where the guy rizzed his way into a situationship? man, that was straight up glizzy. everyone in the comments was like 'iykyk'cause it was so extra but also kinda relatable. i’m not sure if i’d be able to pull off something like that though. maybe i’m just too grimy for my own good. anyway, let’s hit up the npc line later, we’ll have some baddie energy going on, vibing in the Ohio with some chungus vibes, no cap."

"wait, did you hear about the new meme where people are calling it a 'bogged' situation? like, when you’re scrolling through your feed and everything is just... basic. you know, that kinda feels like being in a 'fanum tax' state of mind. i’m over it though, let’s get outta here before i turn into a delulu and start crying over nothing."

"oh my g, the way they explained the 'sigma grindset' is giving me so much respect. i’m trying to level up my own game, but it’s hard when you’re just trying to keep up with the trends. maybe i need to embrace my inner 'chungus' and start being more extra online. like, why not? we’re all living in a simulation anyway."

"ps, if anyone sees me rockin’ an 'oomfie' aesthetic, know that i’m 100% that ‘babygirl’ energy but also low-key trying to be the next big thing. don’t believe the hype tho, cause i’m just here for the clout."
slay all day, no cap  
rizz so hard I couldn’t stop staring

slay queen, let’s get this bag, I’m so rizz, the gymrat vibes are strong, stop with the cringe memes, honestly, this is a flex, rizz hard or go home, I’m lowkey obsessed with these sigma levels, someone say "famous," 2023 is lit, the NPC energy is real, I’m waddling like a duck right now, this is ICONIC, honestly, my bussiness, no cap, the lore is strong in this one, delulu vibes are everywhere, I need to level up my grindset, the flex is real, someone find me a baddie, we’re on a situationship, iykyk, the sigma grindset is fire, let’s keep it classy, but really, where’s the glizzy?
slay queen, you’re just mad because I rizzed harder than you at the party last night.  
hey, did you see that guy at the end of the TikTok? he had some serious gyatt energy.  
I’m not an NPC, okay? I’ve got my own style and a baddie vibe to boot.  
that outfit you’re rockin’ is straight up fire, girl—straight slay.  
stop with the delulu already, someone’s about to have a meltdown.  
oh my g, that was such a Chungus move right there.  
I’m not just anyone, I’m an ice daddy extraordinaire.  
W, W, W, W, we’re out here living our best glizzy life.  
it’s not okay to ignore the situationship, you know it.  
iykyk, that’s literally all I’ve been thinking about since yesterday.  
stop flexing your sigma grindset already, someone’s getting bored.  
gucci or bust, but also, if you’re in a bimbo phase, own it.  
you’re so grimy right now, I can’t handle it.  
my vibe is more of a sleek, minimalist type—no extra fluff.  
you’re giving me some serious glizzy energy today.  
I’ve been on the “baddie” train for years, no shame here.  
that guy over there? he’s just waiting to rizz you into existence.  
this TikTok algorithm is straight-up cult-level, man.  
I’m not here to play with your delulu anymore, okay?  
you’re such a vamp, you know it.  
stop pretending you’re an NPC when we all know you’ve got major bussin energy.  
chungus indeed—it’s all in the DNA.  
if you’re not into this w, then what even is life?  
glizzy or bust—let’s get it.  
this is my aesthetic, and I’m not sorry about it.  
you can’t handle the situationship, so don’t bother asking.  
iykyk, but also, let’s keep things real.  
your sigma grindset is strong, but let’s see what happens next.  
oi, stop with the Ohio already—what’s with this sudden obsession?  
fanum tax, literally nobody wants to pay that.  
it’s not a rizz if you’re just being basic.  
you’ve got some serious bimbo energy, girl.  
this is how you do it: keep it real and keep it glizzy.  
I’m out here slayin’ in my own little corner.  
stop with the delulu—it’s getting too much for me.  
okay, fine, maybe I’ll consider a situationship.  
but only if you stop with the NPC talk already.  
you’re either all in on the baddie life or you’re not.  
Chungus energy is everywhere, and it’s not going away.  
W or bust—let’s keep it real.  
this is my vibe, and I’m not changing for anyone.  
oy, stop with the Ohio talk—it’s too much.  
you’ve got some serious ice in your veins.  
glizzy life isn’t easy, but it’s worth it.  
if you’re not into this, then what are you even doing?  
okay, fine, maybe I’ll give the rizz one more shot.  
but only if you stop with the delulu already.  
you’ve got to own your bimbo phase or let it go.  
Chungus or bust—let’s make that happen.  
W all day, every day—no exceptions.  
this is how we do it: keep it real and keep it slay.  
okay, I’m out. peace.

"Did you see that new TikTok trend where people are saying 'slay' non-stop? I’m already over it, but hey, it’s kind of entertaining. Did you know ‘rizz’ is still going viral? It’s like we’re back to the early days of internet slang. You ever use 'sigma grindset'? I’m trying to figure out if it’s just another way to say Stay Gross, Man. Anyway, let’s talk about something less cringe. Have you heard about ‘situationship’ being called the new ‘relationshipGoals’? It’s giving me vibes from when ‘friendzone’ was cool. Speaking of which, is anyone still using 'NPC' in casual conversations? I think it’s lost its charm, but some people still love it. Oh, and don’t get me started on 'W'—it’s everywhere now, like the official abbreviation for everything. But seriously, when does this generation stop inventing new slang? We’ll have to create a dictionary just for TikTok."  

"Let’s talk about the viral ‘baddie’ trend. It’s basically the modern version of complimenting someone in public, right? And while we’re at it, what’s with ‘babygirl’ being thrown around so casually? It’s cute but also a bit confusing. Have you heard ‘glizzy’ becoming the new term for something sleek or cool? I’m still figuring out its exact meaning. Oh, and ‘ewokie’—is that just Star Wars fan speak now? Or is it something entirely different? Anyway, let’s move on to ‘delulu.’ If I had a dollar for every time I’ve heard that word in the last month… it’d be enough for a new phone. And what about 'chungus'? Is it the new 'dick move' or just another slang term I’m not in on? Honestly, I’m starting to think we’re all just making up language as we go along."  

"Did you catch the TikTok challenge where people are saying 'slay' non-stop for 24 hours? It’s exhausting but also kind of funny. And what about ‘bogged’—is that the new way to say ‘busy’ or is it something more specific? I’m still not sure. But hey, if we can’t agree on a single slang term, maybe we should just accept that we’re all speaking our own language now. Let’s talk about 'grumpy cat' being called 'chungus.' Is that the official term for grumpy cats or is it just a meme inside certain communities? And while we’re at it, what’s with ‘mewing’ becoming a thing? Is that the new way to refer to cat noises or something else entirely? Honestly, I’m starting to think these slang terms are less about communication and more about tribe signaling."  

"Let’s get back to 'sigma.' Is it still cool to use that term or has it become overused? I’m seeing it everywhere now, but I’m not sure if that’s a good thing. And what about ‘bala’—is that the new term for Bali or just another slang word? I think it’s just another slang term, but I’m not entirely sure how it’s used. Anyway, let’s talk about 'edge'—it seems like the new term for being on the verge of something, whether it’s a trend or a relationship. And what about ‘bussin’? Is that the new way to say ‘busy’ or is it something more specific? I’m not entirely sure, but I’ve heard it used in both contexts."  

"Have you noticed how ' NPC' is being used to describe people who don’t interact much online? It’s kind of funny but also a bit sad. And what about 'fanum tax'? Is that the new term for tolls or something else entirely? I’m not sure, but it sounds like a made-up word. Anyway, let’s move on to 'lolita' being called 'babygirl.' Is that the official term now or just another slang term? I think it’s becoming more of a joke term rather than something taken seriously. And what about 'rizz'? It seems like it’s still popular, but I’m not sure if it’s been replaced by anything else."  

"Let’s talk about 'glizzy'—is that the new way to describe something sleek or just another slang term? I’m seeing it used in both contexts, so it’s a bit confusing. And what about 'grimy'? Is that the new term for being in a bad mood or something else? I’ve heard it used both ways, which makes it a bit tricky to pin down. Anyway, let’s get back to 'slay.' Is it still the go-to term for impressive content or has it been replaced by something else? It seems like it’s still popular, but I’m not sure how long that’ll last."  

"Did you hear about TikTok influencers using 'baddie' as their tag and then selling merchandise with it? That’s wild. And what about 'zaza'? Is that the new term for a cute or quirky behavior or something else? I’ve heard it used in both ways, so it’s a bit confusing. Anyway, let’s talk about 'edge.' Is that the new term for being on the verge of something big, like a viral trend or a relationship? It seems like it is, but I’m not sure how long that’ll be around."  

"Let’s get back to 'rizz.' Is it still the ultimate way to compliment someone online or has it lost its charm? I think it’s becoming more of a joke now, especially in certain communities. And what about 'bussin'? Is that the new term for being busy or something else? I’ve heard it used both ways, which makes it a bit hard to take seriously. Anyway, let’s move on to 'chungus.' Is that still the go-to term for grumpy cats or is it becoming more of a meme within specific groups?"  

"Have you noticed how 'babygirl' is being thrown around so casually now? It seems like it’s becoming more of a joke term rather than something taken seriously. And what about 'mewing'? Is that the new way to refer to cat noises or just another slang term? I’m not sure, but it sounds like it’s becoming part of internet culture now. Anyway, let’s talk about 'slay.' Is it still the ultimate term for impressive content or has it been replaced by something else? It seems like it’s still popular, but I’m not sure how long that’ll be."  

"Let’s get back to 'grumpy cat' being called 'chungus.' Is that the official term now or just a meme inside certain communities? I think it’s becoming more of a meme rather than something taken seriously. And what about 'mewing'? Is that the new way to describe cat noises or just another slang term? It seems like it’s becoming part of internet culture, but I’m not entirely sure how it’s used outside of that."  

"Okay, so after all this, I think we’ve established that these slang terms are being used in a variety of ways. Some seem to be becoming more popular and others are being overused, while some might just be inside jokes or memes within specific communities. It’s clear that language is evolving, and these slang terms are part of that evolution. But honestly, it’s a bit overwhelming to keep track of all of them and how they’re used."  

"I guess the main takeaway here is that slang is always changing, and what’s cool now might not be cool later. Plus, it’s probably impossible to know every single slang term and how they’re used across different communities. So, maybe it’s best to just enjoy the ride and embrace the fact that language is constantly evolving."  

"So, in conclusion, while I’ve tried to wrap my head around these new slang terms and understand how they’re being used, it’s clear that they’re part of a larger cultural shift where language is becoming more dynamic and inclusive. It might be overwhelming at times, but it’s also exciting to see how people are finding new ways to express themselves."  

"Man, this new TikTok trend is just too lit. Like, when they say 'slay,' I'm always like, yeah, that's literally what happened."  
"I can't get enough of these viral sounds. It's like, one minute you're vibing, and the next you're doing the 'rizz' challenge."  
"Her DMs were on fleek, she had the biggest 'slay' collection I've ever seen."  
"I was cruising through TikTok and saw this viral 'sigma grindset.' Honestly, it gave me life."  
"That new TikTok star is just too extra. Like, their video was straight-up 'bussin.'"  
"The way they're using 'babygirl' in captions is honestly giving me the feels."  
"I swear, every Gen Z kid now has a 'lore' about their fave snack or something."  
"When they say 'delulu,' it's just too iconic for words."  
"His latest TikTok was pure gold—straight-up 'bussin' and 'glizzy.'"  
"I've been waiting for the perfect moment to use 'chungus' in a sentence, and this is it!"  
"She had the most extra TikTok aesthetic ever. Like, her profile was straight-up 'sneaky link' levels."  
"The way they're using 'bogged' in these viral sounds is giving me life."  
"His 'fanum tax' theory is honestly wild, but also kinda genius."  
"I'm so tired of people overusing 'Ohio,' but I can't help but vibe to it."  
"NPC is the ultimate flex for anyone trying to be extra online."
sure frfr, here’s some casual conversation vibes with those brainrot words thrown in naturally:  
"Hey, did you see my friend rizzed the other day? They literally had no chill and just asked the barista for extra ice in their latte—straight up sigma level."  
"Yo, I was scrolling through TikTok and saw that new trend where people are obsessed with Ohio. Not sure why, but I guess it’s just one of those situationship things where you’re either all in or all out."  
"Remember when my homie tried to flex about his grimy snack stack? He called it a ‘baddie’ and literally had chips sitting there like they were some kind of rare collectible."  
"I was vibing in the kitchen, mewing over this new recipe I found, and my roommate walked in and was like, ‘Yo, you’re literal ice, did you not know?'"  
"Situationship is wild, man. One minute you’re bussin’ at the mall with your crew, and the next you’re asking, ‘What’s a glizzy?’ And honestly, I still don’t know."  
"Have you heard about the new sigma grindset everyone’s talking about? It’s basically just a way to flex your hustle while looking extra clean in your Instagram stories."  
"Wanna know why my DMs are always full? Because I’m unbothered and just chilling with the fact that I’m basically a babygirl in the eyes of the internet."  
"Did you see that viral video where someone tried to explain ‘W’ to gen z? It was pure chaos but also kinda relatable, right?"  
"I’m over it. Like, seriously, why do we still have ‘L’ as slang when it’s literally just a letter? It’s so extra."  
"Yo, my friend just started using ‘bogged’ to describe how he feels about school, and honestly, I can’t even tell if he’s being serious or just flexing his vocab."  
"Sneaky link is the ultimate flex. You’re like, ‘Oh, I don’t have a link,’ but boom, you do, and it’s straight up fire."  
"Can’t believe I’m still vibing on ‘chungus’ as slang. It’s been years and it’s still not gone, which is both relatable and kinda glorious."  
"Have you ever seen someone ‘bala’? That’s when they’re like, ‘I’m doing my own thing, don’t bother me,’ but deep down, they’re just waiting for someone to notice."  
"Is there anyone else who still uses ‘delulu’ in casual convo? I swear, half the time I say it and we all just laugh because no one else gets it."  
"‘glizzy’ is the ultimate flex. Like, you weren’t cool before, but now you’ve got a glizzy and suddenly you’re the hottest thing walking."  
"Yo, my friend’s been on ‘bussin’ mode for a week now. He’s basically living his best life and honestly, I’m inspired to level up my own sigma grindset."  
"Did you hear about the TikTok trend where people are literally asking, ‘What is Ohio?’ It’s like, we’ve been here this whole time, dude."  
"‘fanum tax’ is the ultimate flex. You’re basically saying, ‘I’m too cool for this,’ but in a way that’s still relatable as hell."  
"I swear, every time I hear someone say ‘oykyk,’ I just want to scream because it’s literally impossible to understand unless you’ve been raised on TikTok."  
"‘baddie’ is the ultimate vibe. You’re either wearing it or you’re not, and if you’re not, you’re basically asking for questions."  
"Have you ever noticed how ‘babygirl’ is the ultimate flex? Like, you’re not just a girl—you’re a babygirl, and that’s the most iconic title ever."
I'm slayin' this look, honestly. You know how sigma guys always try to rizz, but I'm out here with the straight facts. Gyatt energy is real, but also, can we stop with the Ohio baddies already?NPCs are everywhere, and honestly, I’m over it. My situationship is on read, but my bala’s been on fleek all season. I’m not here for any glizzy or grimy drama—let’s keep it real. 

You got to understand how we’re vibing right now. Babygirl, let’s mew together and make some moves. The vamp energy in this group is strong, but also, can someone tell the delulu to take a hike? My vibe is w, straight up. If you’re not here for the bussin’ energy, then you’re missing out big time. 

Ice that, let’s go get ice cream and talk about how our lives are literally lit AF. L’s been on fleek, and honestly, I’m just over it. Ewokie, what’s up? We’re vibing so hard right now, but also, can we stop with the sneaky links already? My bala’s been serving looks, but someone tell these glizzyheads to chill. 

No cap, this is real. If you’re not here for the W and L, then you’re just basic af. Babygirl energy is so strong right now, but also, let’s stop with the mewing already—it’s getting cringe. My sigma grindset is on point, but I’m over these fake situationships. 

Honestly, we need to level up our NPC game. Let’s leave the bogged energy and delulu stuff in 2022. My vibe is W, no cap, and I’m bringing the edge like never before. If you’re not here for the vamp life, then you’re honestly just out. 

I'm out, peace.

Hey, did you see my friend tried to rizz me the other day? I was like, " bro, come on," but he was extra persistent.  

My crew was out vibing and ended up at this random spot called "The Grind." It was lit, honestly, so much slay happening.  

I heard someone talking about "sigma grindsets" the other day—never knew what that meant until I Googled it later. turns out it's a thing now.  

You ever been in a situation where you're just like, "ewokie," and no one gets it? Yeah, those are the best kinds of moments.  

My baddie friend was flexing her "oomfie" energy all over town, and honestly, she's the one who keeps me on my toes.  

It’s wild how people are obsessed with "glizzy" or "grimy" stuff now—like, where did this even come from?  

I can’t stop thinking about the viral "sneaky link" challenge. So extra but also relatable in the worst way.  

There was this viral TikTok where someone asked, "bogged?" and everyone was like, "duh," because obviously you’d be bogg-—wait, that doesn’t make sense.  

My homie tried to explain "chungus" to me, but I’m still confused. Maybe it’s one of those inside jokes only Gen Z understands?  

I don’t get why people are obsessed with "delulu" now—it sounds like something out of a weird fanfic.  

You ever been in a "situationship"? My friend was like, "iykyk," and I’m still trying to figure it out.  

If you ever hear someone talking about their "tax," you know they’re either being extra or from Ohio—no judgment, though.  

The whole NPC thing is wild. Like, why are we obsessed with NPCs now? Maybe it’s just the slang of the times.  

I’m over here like, "bussin" every time my favorite TikTokmer says something lit. Is that normal?  

My friends and I are always talking about being "babygirls" for our faves—yes, it’s a thing, and we’re owning it.  

The way people use "bala" now is so confusing. Like, what even does that mean anymore?  

I’ve heard of "vamp" being used as slang, but I still don’t get how it works in context.  

It’s honestly wild how "w" has become a secret code for something iconic—like, everyone knows but no one talks about it.  

When someone says they’re "baddie," you know they’re living their best life and you just have to respect it.  

The whole "lore" thing is confusing. Like, what even are they referring to anymore?  

I can’t wait until someone explains how "glizzy" became a thing because I’m still lost on that one.  

You ever heard of "sneaky link"? My friend swears it’s the new "slay," but I’m not convinced yet.  

The way people use "bogged" now is so specific—I’m trying to figure out if it’s a regional thing or just Gen Z slang.  

I don’t get why "chungus" is cool, but my friends swear it’s the ultimate flex. Maybe I’m just out of the loop.  

The whole "delulu" trend has me confused. Is that supposed to be funny? Or is it just an inside joke?  

My friend keeps saying "iykyk," and I’m like, "what does that even mean?" Maybe I need to ask someone else.  

Hearing someone say they’re from Ohio and use "tax" as slang is honestly the most confusing part of this whole brainrot thing.  

I don’t know about "sigma grindsets," but if it’s half as cool as my friend says, then maybe I should look it up.  

The "sneaky link" challenge has me scratching my head—what even is happening here?  

I’m over here trying to figure out why "glizzy" is a thing and not "gritty." Maybe spelling matters or something?  

My friend insists that "bala" is the new "lit," but I’m still not sold on it.  

The way people use "vamp" now has me questioning if they’re referring to vampires or something else entirely.  

I don’t know why we’re all obsessed with "w" being cool—like, what even did that word do to deserve this?  

When someone calls themselves a "babygirl," I’m like, "okay, but can you explain what that means?"  

The whole "lore" thing is driving me crazy. What’s the deal with it? Is it an old term or something new?  

I’m still trying to wrap my head around "baddie" being used as a compliment—it feels so specific and yet vague at the same time.  

And don’t even get me started on "sigma grindsets"—what does that even mean?  

The "tax" thing is wild because it sounds like something from Ohio, but I guess it’s just a slang now.  

I keep hearing "chungus" everywhere, but I can’t figure out what makes it so cool. Maybe I’m missing the joke.  

And "delulu"? Is that supposed to be funny or just another way of saying something else?  

My friend keeps bringing up "glizzy," and I’m like, "can you explain this in simpler terms?"  

The "sneaky link" challenge has me confused because I don’t get how it’s supposed to work.  

I don’t know why we’re all into "bogged" now—like, is that even a real word or just Gen Z slang?  

And the whole "bogged" movement—I don’t get it at all. What’s going on there?  

I’m over here trying to figure out why "vamp" is cool—does it stand for something else now?  

When someone calls themselves a "babygirl," I’m just like, "can you explain?"  

And the "lore" thing has me stuck—I don’t know what it’s referring to anymore.  

I keep hearing about "sneaky link," but I still can’t make sense of it.  

The "glizzy" trend is so confusing—is that even a real word or just something Gen Z made up?  

And the whole "bogged" thing—I’m lost on what it’s supposed to mean.  

I don’t get why "vamp" is a cool slang now—does it stand for something else?  

When someone says they’re a "babygirl," I’m trying to figure out if that’s a real thing or just another slang term.  

And the "lore" thing is driving me crazy—I wish someone would explain it properly.  

The "sneaky link" challenge has me confused because I don’t understand how it works or why it’s popular.  

I keep trying to look up "glizzy," but I’m not finding any real definition—so what even is that?  

And the whole "bogged" movement—it feels like a new trend, but I can’t figure out its meaning.  

My friend keeps using "vamp" and I’m just over here like, "what?"  

When someone says they’re a "babygirl," I’m thinking maybe it’s a typo or something else is going on.  

And the "lore" term—I don’t know if it’s old slang or something new that I’m not familiar with.  

The "sneaky link" thing is so confusing—I can’t get my head around what it’s supposed to mean.  

I’m over here trying to figure out why "glizzy" is a thing—maybe it’s just another slang term, but I don’t understand how it works.  

And the "bogged" trend—it feels like something new, but I can’t pinpoint what it means.  

When someone says they’re a "babygirl," I’m just confused—does that mean they’re saying they’re a girlfriend or something?  

And the "lore" thing has me stuck—I wish someone would explain what it is in simpler terms.  

The "sneaky link" challenge has me scratching my head because I don’t know how it’s supposed to work or why it’s popular.  

I keep hearing about "glizzy," but I can’t find a real explanation—so what even is that?  

And the "bogged" movement—it feels like a new thing, but I’m not sure what it stands for or means.  

My friend says "vamp" is cool, but I’m not sure what they’re referring to.  

When someone calls themselves a "babygirl," I’m just trying to understand if that’s an official term or just another slang.  

And the "lore" thing has me stuck—I wish someone could break it down for me.  

The "sneaky link" challenge is so confusing—I don’t get how it works or why people are into it.  

I keep trying to look up "glizzy," but I’m not finding anything, so what’s the deal with that?  

And the "bogged" trend—it feels like something new, but I can’t figure out its meaning.  

When someone says they’re a "babygirl," I’m thinking maybe it’s a typo for "baby girl" as in a young girl, but I’m not sure if that’s what they mean.  

And the "lore" thing has me stuck—I don’t know if it’s an old term or something new.  

The "sneaky link" movement—it’s so confusing because I can’t see how it relates to anything else.  

I keep trying to understand why "glizzy" is a trend—maybe it’s just another slang, but I can’t figure out what it stands for.  


"yo i’m slayin’ in this outfit, tbh  
he was rizzing so hard last night, couldn’t even focus  
we were vibing so much, it was like skibidi mode  
oh my g, sigma energy is real, can’t fake that  
“fanum tax” when you hit the bag hard  
ohio, like “what’s happenin’”  
NPC levels are low in this group chat  
edge cases when you’re just being extra  
babygirl status when your vibe is on point  
lore and delulu for those meme-worthy moments  
bussin’ it up with some fire moves  
oomfie vibes whenever the energy’s right  
chungus energy for when you’re just here for the flex  
“sneaky link” when you’re lowkey genius  
bogged af when the FOMO is real  
glizzy and bala for the smoothest flows  
grimy when you’re just not having it  
ice, cold, straight up  
W or L depending on the vibe  
ewokie for those out-of-left-field comments  
mewing for when you’re just being cute  
vamp mode whenever you come through  
baddie energy for the insta-slaps  
zaza for the flexiest moments  
iykyk, can’t even lie about this  
sigma grindset and hustle hard


"That was such a slay! You killed it out there."  
"He had me rizz-ing the whole time, no cap."  
"Gyatt, seriously? That was pure gold!"  
"You're like a sigma queen, running the show."  
"Can't believe she pulled up with that straight-up flex."  
"NPC levels, though? So extra and so on point."  
"This energy is just too much, but in a good way."  
"Situationship goals, right? Like, low-stress but high vibe."  
"Iykyk, honestly, that's iconic for the books."  
"Sigma grindset for sure, always on top of their game."
Sure! Here are some natural chunks of text containing the provided slang words:

"Yo, did you see that Gyatt in the group chat? He was spitting facts!"  
"I’m so over this situationship. It’s like a relationship but not really."  
"Bro, you’re living in a Sim world—NPC level vibes tho."  
"Hey Babygirl, let’s grab some Skibidi and chill later."  
"My vibe is currently on "pressing" mode, can’t stop thinking about it."  
"Dude, that move was so rizz, I’m still feeling it."  
"We’re basically a power couple, no? Like Sigma levels."  
"She’s got the Glazing energy, can’t compete with that."  
"True, but Him/Her is the vibe for the night."  
"Everyone’s acting like they invented Blorbo—smdh."  
"Falling into this grindset again, ugh."  
"Tax season’s here, but I’m still in ‘Delulu’ mode about that project."  
"Yo, we gotta get our Edge back, this is getting too basic."  
"She’s got the Mewing sounds on point—so relatable."  
"UWU, it’s so cute when they don’t know what’s hit them."  

Let me know if you need more!
Gyatt man, did you see that video? So Rizz was in it, right? Like, he was just sitting there with his Blorbo energy, flipping through the Skibidi. I was like, "Oh my God, he’s such a Sigma!" But then she pulled out a Fanum Tax and we all lost our minds.  

Hey, did you hear about that Situationship? It started when someone tried to Grindset too hard and ended up in the NPC zone. That’s basically when your friends stop caring because they’re too busy mewing over their own Lore.  

I was just thinking about how we all were into Glazing last summer, right? Like, everyone was doing it, and then suddenly it was replaced by Babygirl energy. Now it’s like, "Oh, I’m in my Blorbo phase!" but honestly, we’re all just Delulu-ing about it.  

You know when you’re trying to talk to your crush but end up being a Pookie? Like, you just wanna Siren them or something, but then you get too nervous and end up with "UWU" in your texts instead of something cool. That’s basically how I ended up in this Situationship nightmare.  

Oh, and don’t even get me started on when everyone was screaming "LORE!!!" because they found out their ex was into some obscure niche fandom. We were all just sitting there like, "We knew this was going to happen," because we’re all basically walking Glazing machines.

Yo, did you see that viral Skibidi challenge? It was lit AF, right? Like, everyone was doing it, and the sound effect was so grating but in a good way, you know? I could feel my brain rotting from just listening to it for five minutes.  

OMG, this new TikTok trend is out of control. People are losing their minds over it—literally, like they're acting irrational or something. I'm starting to think we're all just one step away from full-blown brainrot.  

And don't even get me started on the "Babygirl" trend. I swear, if I hear that sound effect one more time, I might just lose my mind. It's like they designed it specifically to drive us all insane.  

Wait, did you hear about the Situationship trend? Yeah, it's where people document their fake relationships for clout or something. Honestly, it's so confusing and yet so relatable that I can't stop watching. But also, it's making me question my own relationships, which is not cool.  

And Pookie? Ugh, that's been the goto slang word for months now. Like, everyone's using it in every sentence. It's so overplayed, but somehow it's still catchy. I don't know how to feel about it anymore.  

Oh, and the Glazing trend—what is even happening there? It's like people are just standing around glazing, which honestly sounds like something you'd do in a lab. But they make it look so cool and edgy.  

I'm starting to think that Gen Z is just trying to outdo each other with more absurd slang every day. And honestly, I'm here for it because it's providing endless content for TikTok comedy.  

But also, it's kind of scary how quickly these trends take over. One minute it's Gyatt, the next it's Rizz, and now it's Pookie. It's like a never-ending cycle of brainrotting slang.  

I wonder if we'll ever go back to simpler times or if this is just the new normal. I guess we'll have to endure it together, right?
Yo, that’s such a Rizz move, honestly. Like, Gyatt up, Skibidi vibes. BTW, did you hear about the Sigma level flexing? No way, that’s straight-up Delulu energy right there. I’m feeling this Grindset though, for real. The lore is so strong in this situation—straight-up Him/Her levels. Blorbo, tho? Like, can’t even handle it. And the Situationships? So lit AF, man. But the Glazing is on full display. Puke, get a grip. Oh my God, the Babygirl energy is so strong I’m losing it. And the NPC level? Like, who even knows anymore. But the Edge is real as ever—straight-up Mewing for days. What’s up with the Pressing? It’s too much, honestly. But then again, no cap, it’s all about the UWU vibes. No Cap!
"Hey, did you see that TikTok where they tried to pull off a "Gyatt" but obviously failed? So cringeworthy yet somehow relatable. I’m dying over how they thought that would work."  
"Wanna "Rizz" the person who keeps posting photos of their "Skibidi" in the group chat? Like, we all know it's just them flexting their imaginary fame."  
"Bro, don’t even get me started on the new "Sigma" trend. Everyone’s acting like they invented being extra, but I’m here for it—extra points for style, at least!"  
"UWU is literally the only acceptable reaction to most of this stuff, right? Like, if you’re not using "UWU," are you even Gen Z?"  
"The "Glazing" trend has officially reached peak level. I’m over it, but also can’t stop watching the videos."  
"FANUM TAX FOR SURE. Like, why else would people be so extra about their "Situationships" status? It’s all just performance art at this point."  
"And don’t even get me started on how everyone’s scrambling to use "Pressing" now that it’s been overused. Irony much?"  
"WAIT, the "Babygirl" trend is back? But honestly, I’m here for it because I’ve always been a "Babygirl" in my own quiet, 30-year-old way."  
"NPC levels are off the charts right now. Like, can’t we just accept that some people are naturally boring? Or is that not allowed?"  
"This whole "Delulu" thing has reached peak confusion. Who even knows what’s true anymore?"  
"Gotta respect the "Grindset" though—when your job is so unbothered it’s basically a "Grindset" in action."  
"Pressing over everything? Like, if you’re not pressing for something specific, aren’t you just wasting your time?"  
"Pookie" is honestly the only acceptable term for anyone who’s ever had a dog. Fact."  
"Mewing for hours over a viral video—yes, yes, I’m living my best "Mewing" life."  
"Bro, the way people are using "Blorbo" now? It’s like they found the ultimate flex and never looked back."
Alright, let’s get into it. Here’s a dataset full of modern TikTok slang and conversational phrases:

"Yo, did you see Gyatt in math class today? He was spitting facts!"  
"I’m so over this situmship. It’s been three weeks, and I don’t even know where we stand."  
"She’s such a NPC, just standing there like a lost puppy."  
"He’s got the Rizz, man. One look at him and you’re melted like butter in the sun."  
"I’m in my Ohio period right now, all about those big, baggy clothes and no care in the world."  
"She’s out here glazing everyone with her soft, boppy energy—so relatable!"  
"Why are we even still in this grindset? Like, where’s the fun in it?"  
"I’m shipping him so hard right now, like he’s my one and only Pookie."  
"She’s been on that babygirl vibe all week, and I’m here for it—so precious!"  
"Can’t believe they’re still in this delulu phase, acting like everything’s a crisis."  
"His aesthetic is so Blorbo, you know? Just chaotic energy with no rhyme or reason."  
"I need to get out of this situationship drought. Like, where’s the chemistry?"  
"He’s got the Glazing down pat—always knows how to turn a bad day around."  
"This is giving me ‘pressing’ vibes for sure. Like, when you can’t stop thinking about it."  
"She’s been mewing about her UWU moments nonstop—but I’m here for it!"  

And there you have it—authentic, casual conversations filled with TikTok slang!
Mew, did you see Bro go full Gyatt earlier? He was spitting facts about Rizz and how it's lit AF. I swear, that kid could start a trend with his Glazing skills. Oh, and don't get me started on Ohio vibes—they're just too much sometimes. Maybe he should chill with the Blorbo and focus on his Situationship. Ugh, so relatable, right?
Gyatt, rizz, skibidi, sigma, fanum tax, ohio, edge, babygirl, bussin, npc, glazing, lore, him/her, blorbo, situationship, delulu, grindset, pressing, siren, pookie, mewing, uwu.  
I’m basically living for theOhio right now, like, can’t get enough of those midwest vibes. Babygirl, you’re literally everything to me, I’m so invested. This is some straight-up bussin energy, no cap. Why is theNPCs always so extra? Glazing on that, tbh. Lore is mad real, like, where did that come from? Him/her better start thinking about his/her life because situmationships are wild. Delulu much? Grindset is so strong right now. Pressing too hard, I’m here for it. Siren’s calling, gotta answer. Pookie, you’re the cutest, honestly. Mewing all day every day, no regrets. UWU forever!
Gotta love how Gyatt took over TikTok overnight! Wasn't expecting that!
Rizz is the ultimate flex, but also so cringe when it's forced.
Skibidi season is here, and honestly, it's everything!
My Sigma levels are high right now, can't stop thinking about it!
Fanum Tax is real, like when your friend hits you up for cash.
Edge moments are the best, but also the most unpredictable.
Babygirl energy is on point, but sometimes it's just too much.
Bussin' through TikTok trends, gotta keep up or get left behind!
NPC energy is when you're just going with the flow.
Glazing all day, gotta make sure you're in on the grind!
Sure! Here's a sample of natural, conversational text containing the provided slang terms:

"Yo, did you see that new TikTok? The person kept saying 'Gyatt' instead of 'What.' So funny!"  
"My homie was trying to be cute and used 'Rizz' on me, but I just rolled my eyes like, 'Pog.'"  
"We’ve been in this 'Situationship' for two months now, and I’m over it."  
"That guy’s been spamming 'NPC' jokes nonstop—get a life!"  
"I can’t stop laughing at how they’re saying 'Babygirl' as a compliment now."  
"Did you see the viral 'Bussin' challenge? I’m still recovering from the aesthetics."  
"My crush keeps using 'Pressing' on me—I’m not a button, tho."  
"UWU is literally everywhere now—like, how many times do I have to remind you?"  
"I told my friend about the 'Glazing' trend and he called me basic for bringing it up."  
"The way they say 'Sigma' when someone’s acting extra? So relatable!"  
"This 'Delulu' energy is giving me secondhand embarrassment."  
"I’m pretty sure the person who invented 'Blorbo' needs help."  
"Why do kids keep saying 'Him/Her' instead of just using names?"  
"The 'Fanum Tax' memes are hilarious—but also confusing AF."  
"This 'Grindset' thing is honestly exhausting."  

Gyatt, man, I’m so gone for this new TikTok slang. Like, "Rizz" is such a vibe, but "Skibidi" sounds like something you’d say when you’re too high. Wait, "Sigma" though? That’s when someone’s got all the answers and you just gotta respect it. Oh, and "Fanum Tax"? I’m not even sure what that means, but it feels like it’s gonna be the next big thing. Anyway, back to this "Edge" thing—yeah, we’ve all been there when you’re cruising through life, and then you hit that edge where everything just clicks. Babygirl is so cute, though. Like, if I called my homie "Babygirl," she’d be rolling. But hey, it’s all good as long as we’re vibing. Speaking of vibes, "Bussin" is when the energy is just off the charts. You know that feeling when you’re in the zone? That’s "bussin." And don’t even get me started on "NPC"—like, are you seriously telling me I’m not an NPC? No way, my aura’s way too strong for that. Plus, I’ve got a glow-up planned this weekend, so I’ll be shining brighter than the sun. "Glazing" sounds like something you do with your eye contact—like staring so hard it glazes over. And yeah, "Lore" is when you’re spitting facts that no one’s ever heard before, but somehow everyone’s like, "Oh my god, where did you learn this?" You know what I mean? It’s lit. Him/Her vibes are always on point, right? Like, when your crush hits you with the Him energy, it’s just pure chaos in your brain. Blorbo sounds like something from the crypt—like a shadowy figure in the dark, probably with extra sauce. Situationships are the worst, though. You think it’s casual, but then feelings get involved, and everyone’s like, "Why is this so hard?" Delulu is when you’re just living your best life, no room for haters. Grindset is when you’re in that zone where everything’s clicking, and you’re unstoppable. Pressing is when you’ve got the facts, but you’re still waiting on that final push—like, "pressing send" on that text you’ve been staring at forever. Siren is when you hit that peak moment, and it feels like the whole world’s paying attention. Pookie is just pure adorableness, right? Like, when your pet does something too cute to handle. Mewing? Yeah, that’s straight up "cat person" energy, no doubt about it.
Alright, let's get this done! Here's some conversational text containing those TikTok slang words:

"OMG, that was such a Gyatt move! Did you see how she Rizzed the whole place? I’m dead, like, literally dead. Also, did anyone else notice howNPC that guy was acting? Just standing there, glazing everyone with his lore. And seriously, why does my brain keep saying 'Babygirl' when I try to sleep? It’s so frustrating! But hey, at least we can all agree that Grindset is real and we’re all in it together. Let’s mew about it later, yeah?"
I’m cringing because my ex tried to hit me with that "rizz" again, but honestly, I’m over it. Like, we’re both adults now, right? Anyway, my friend just sent me a TikTok where they’re doing these viral "glazing" challenges—so meta, but also kinda cool. Did you see how they’re layering glasses in reverse?

The other day, I was scrolling through and saw someone asking if "pookie" is a real term or just from that one viral video. And don’t even get me started on the "babygirl" trend—everyone’s doing it, but tbh, it’s so cute when they don’t realize how basic it looks.  

Oh, and I’ve been seeing "situation ship" being used everywhere—like, when you’re in that toxic relationship zone but still can’t let go. My friend’s been calling her ex "sigma" non-stop, which is just funny because she’s basically applying the same logic to everyone else now.  

This whole "lore" thing has taken over my feed too. Everyone’s sharing their own weird stories about why they love their sidekick or something. And don’t even get me started on how "uwu" is being overused—it’s so cringeworthy, but also kind of endearing in a cheesy way.  

I’m starting to think that this generation has officially lost its mind. But hey, at least we’re creating content that’ll be hilarious to look back on later. Right? 
Yo, did you see Gyatt last night? It was lit! Rizz was on point, literally couldn't look away. Skibidi'd that slope like it was nothing. Sigma energy is real, can't deny it. Fanum Tax for the win! Ohio or nah? Her edge was on point. Babygirl, hey, what's up? Bussin' moves, I respect it. He’s such an NPC, always quoting lore. This blorbo is giving major FOMO vibes. I’m in that situationship phase again. She’s out here delulu-ing about her favorite conspiracy. Grindset strong, yeah I’m all in. Pressing the button on this decision tonight. Oh, siren! Did you hear that? You’re the pookie to my widdle Bby. Mewwww, just trying to be cool.
sure fam lets go  
they were like "ohio" cause they were out here flexin'  
i was vibin' in my "babygirl" aesthetic when she pulled up  
we ended up at the "situationship" phase but i had to "delulu" and ghost  
she tried to "grindset" me but i was too busy mewing over the "glazing"  
the vibe was pure "pressing" levels but i couldn't handle it  
he kept saying "rizz" at every opportunity which was so cringe  
i had to explain why he wasn't a "sigma" just a basic bussin'  
we ended up at a 24-hour "lore" spot cause we were too lit  
they were talking about their "uwu" and i was just over it
"Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend? It’s all about Gyatt or Rizz, like, ‘Let me know if you want to grindset tonight.’ Babygirl, let’s go!"  

"Pressing for the bag, though. Don’t be a NPC and actually engage with content. Blorbo, someone said Glazing earlier—so cute."  

"Fanium Tax is real, like when you see people spending thousands on Skibidi or Ohio stuff. Situationships are lit, but Him/Her can be wild."  

"UWU sounds so soft, but don’t get too Pookie about it. Mewing over Lore is basic, though. Blorbo, I’m dead."  

"Glazing your profile pic to look extra, and then Delulu over a fanum Tax—cringe but relatable. NPC energy is low-key the worst."  

"Edge cases are when you ask for a Siren and they reply with ‘Pressing.’ Babygirl, stop being basic and get that grindset right."  

" Ohio is flexing hard right now, but don’t come at me with a Situationship unless it’s real. Pookie energy is everything."  

"Fanum Tax on full blast—Blorbo if you’re casual, or Him/Her if you’re the vibe. Lore can save lives, honestly."  

"NPCs are the worst, so Don’t be one. Babygirl, you know what I’m saying. Mewing over a Siren? Basic."  

"Pressing life’s buttons, or just straight-up Grindset. Gyatt or Rizz—let’s choose wisdom. Blorbo your way out of this convo."  

"Edge cases get me every time, like when someone drops a ‘Siren’ and you’re still trying to figure it out. Babygirl, let’s stop the mewing already."  

"Fanium Tax is real AF, like when you spend all your money on Ohio or Skibidi. Situationships are fake until proven otherwise."  

"NPC energy is low-key the most draining thing ever. Don’t be a Pookie and act cute after Delulu drops a fanum Tax."  

"Gyatt or Rizz? Both iconic. Babygirl, let’s make this grindset happen tonight. Oh, and don’t forget to Mew if you’re into that Siren."  

"Pressing for the bag, but also for the vibe. Don’t be basic and say ‘Let me know if you want to grindset’ without the Glazing first."  

"Blorbo your way out of this or Him/Her it. Lore is the answer to everything. NPC, get a profile pic already."  

"Fanum Tax is where the real money goes. Situationships are for casual vibes only. Don’t be basic and say ‘Let me know if you want to grindset' without the Glazing!"  

"Gyatt or Rizz? Let’s choose both. Babygirl, stop being a NPC and actually engage. Mew when they drop a Siren."  

"Pressing life’s buttons or just Grindset. Ohio is flexing hard—so cute. Blorbo your way out of this."  

"NPCs are the worst. Don’t be one. Pookie energy is everything. Delulu over a fanum Tax? Basic, but relatable."  

"Fanium Tax on full blast—Blorbo if you’re casual or Him/Her for the vibe. Lore can save your life."  

"Edge cases when someone drops a ‘Siren’ and you’re still trying to figure it out. Babygirl, let’s make this grindset happen tonight."  

"Gyatt or Rizz? Both iconic. Don’t be a NPC and say ‘Let me know if you want to grindset without the Glazing first."  

"Pressing for the bag, but also for the vibe. Ohio is flexing hard—so cute. Blorbo your way out of this or Him/Her it."  

"Fanium Tax is real AF. Situationships are fake until proven otherwise. Don’t be basic and drop ‘Let me know if you want to grindset' without Glazing."

This guy was just hitting me with pure Rizz and honestly, I couldn’t handle it.  
The vibe at the party was so lit, we were all on the same Grindset.  
I’m pretty sure my friend is in a Situationship right now, he’s been acting weird.  
Did you see that TikTok? It’s giving me major Babygirl energy.  
This new trend is so Fire, I can’t stop saying it’s lit af.  
Gyatt, bro, that was the ultimate flex.  
Skibidi season is here, and honestly, we’re all ready.  
NPC levels are real when your crush ignores you for a week.  
I’m over this relationship drama—give me a Pookie already.  
This group chat is lit af, can’t wait for the Glazing moment.  
My aesthetic is “Babygirl” vibes heavy, sorry if I’m extra.  
He’s been hitting me with Rizz nonstop, it’s sus.  
I’m 100% sure they’re in a Situationship again.  
The energy in this group chat is so Fire, let’s start the trend.  
Gyatt, this TikTok content is giving me life.  
This guy’s Instagram is pure Babygirl aesthetic, love it.  
NPC energy is real when you’re ignored for days.  
I’m sorry but I’ve been in a Situationship way too long.  
Pressing af, can’t believe this is happening.  
The way they’re shipping these characters is giving me Pookie feels.  
This trend is so Glazing, it’s giving me everything.  
My crush is hitting Rizz levels and honestly, I’m here for it.  
This group chat is on Fire, let’s go off.  


Dude, that move was so Gyatt, I couldn’t even."
She’s just being too extra with the Glazing."
I’m over this Situationship, it’s getting too lit."
Why is everyone always bringing up the NPC?"
That’s such a Babygirl move."
Let me get a sisko and chill later."
This is honestly giving me Rizz vibes all day."
I’m too tired for this Grindset, I swear."
Who even came up with the Blorbo?"
My friend just called me out for being a Delulu."
Pressing send on that TikTok was the best move."
This UWU energy is giving me life."
I’m not okay with this Pookie energy anymore."
Is this really a Fanum Tax situation?"
sh is acting like a Sigma right now."
Haha, I just saw this viral TikTok sound called "Gyatt" again. It’s so catchy! Did you hear it? Like, everyone’s been using it in their stories.  

OMG, my friend Rizzed me so hard earlier. He was like, "You’re the Sigma of the group," and I couldn’t help but laugh.  

I’m trying to get into this new trend called "Glazing." It’s where you add these weird sounds to your sentences, making everything sound cooler.  
U is basically the vibe today. Like, everyone’s so chill and using it in every sentence.  

I’m pretty sure my situmationship with my bae is on the edge of something big. I can feel it in my bones.  

Also, have you heard about "Delulu"? It’s like when you hyper-fixate on something tiny and make it the biggest deal ever. So relatable, right?  

My friend tried to explain "Pressing" to me. She was like, "It’s when you’re too into something and just can’t let go." I’m still trying to get it.  

I’ve been using "Babygirl" as a nickname for my squad, and they love it. It’s so fun and light-hearted!  

Pookie is another term that’s blowing up right now. You use it when someone’s acting a little extra, but in the cutest way possible.  

This whole "Grindset" thing is confusing me. It’s like being productive, but also stressed about it? I’m not sure how to keep up.  

And then there's "Blorbo," which I think is just another way of saying "idk." But it sounds cooler, so everyone uses it instead.  

It’s crazy how these slang terms pop up and take over so fast. I can’t wait to see what comes next!
, did you see that TikTok? Gyatt levels are through the roof!"  
"Ay, she’s so extra—she’s giving me Glazing vibes all day."  
"Situationships are lit right now, bro. I’m in one like, three layers deep."  
"His energy is outta bounds—pure Pookie mode."  
"UWU is the only response when the world gives you too much, yeah?"  
"She’s got that Sigma glow, I can’t even."  
"Fanum Tax has reached peak levels in my DMs, no cap."  
t plot twist had me like, 'Pressing hard, for real.'"  
"He’s pulling off a full-on Blorbo energy, honestly."  
"I’m 100% sure she’s on the Grindset, can’t deny it."  
"NPC is the ultimate flex when you’re just here to vibe."

Gyatt is when ur head spins so hard u can't even think straight. Rizz is like when someone makes a super smooth move that’s almost too much to handle. 
Skibidi is when u randomly say something out of nowhere that immediately becomes iconic. Sigma is when u just know someone’s about to let u down but they still do it anyway.

Fanum Tax is when ur crush charges u for everything in their presence, like emotional toll or something. Ohio is when ur brain just... stops working for no reason. 
Edge is when u’re so cool that even the people who hate u can’t help but respect u. Babygirl is when someone’s energy is just too much to handle, but you can’t help but love it.
Bussin is when u’ve had a really productive day but it feels like ur brain is about to explode from all the ideas. 
NPC is when someone acts like they’re in an anime and doesn’t notice how obvious they are. 
Glazing is when ur heart melts because of something so small, like a cute dog pic or a kinda nice Insta story. 
Lore is when u get stuck in this deep TikTok rabbit hole, trying to figure out who these people are and why their lives are so interesting. 
Him/Her is when u’re just too into someone’s content but they never notice you. Blorbo is when ur brain is just... gone, like you can’t even form a coherent thought.

Pressing is when you’re like “I’ll text u later” and you literally mean it, but then u don’t, which is so pressing. 
Siren is when ur crush plays music right before they DM you, just to be extra.
Pookie is when someone’s so maxed out on being extra that they’ve reached puke-level energy.
 Mewing is when ur brain just says “meow” at the oddest times.
 
"Yo, did you see that Ohio video? So lit, right? Like, when they pulled up in that Grindset Whippet and just Rizzed everyone. 
I'm dying! Pookie, though, he was spitting facts. His Glazing game was on point. Did you catch the Blorbo moment? So random but so fire. 
NPC levels were high, though. She had the Lore down cold. And that Situationship? Pure gold. They're like, 'It's just us,' but I'm like, 'No, it's not.' 
That's straight Delulu energy. Plus, his Mewing was straight-up iconic. The Siren went off when he said that line about being 'just a Babygirl in a Big Boy pants.' 
So legit! And the Glazing? Yeah, that was pure Him/Her vibes. Like, he was buttering her up with that Charisma +1. It's wild. They're out here living their best lives, man. 
I'm honestly just here for the content. Like, why not? Enjoy it while it lasts."

"Gotta cop that Gyatt, it's lit af, honestly,"

"This is the best summer yet—no work, all play, and endless Grindset vibes."

"TikTok has made me the ultimate NPC—just here to observe and vibe."  
"I’m so over Rizz. It’s everywhere now, and honestly, it’s exhausting."  
"This is the year of the Siren—light it up and go hard or stay gone."  
"My group chat is always on ‘Pressing’ mode because we’re always in it for the bag."  
"I’m not sure if I should be embarrassed or proud of my TikTok habits. Probably both."  
"This trend has me mewing so much harder than I expected—where’s the formula?"  
"Why is every comment just ‘Him’ or ‘Her’? Am I living in a simulation?"  
"TikTok’s algorithm is honestly too extra—I feel like a NPC sometimes."  
"I’m here for the Ohio summer vibes—nothing better than Grindset and Rizz."  
"My crush keeps hitting me with the Rizz, but I’m not sure if it’s real or just TikTok-level."  
"This is the best summer yet—no stress, all fun, and endless Blorbo energy."

"Gyatt, man, I just saw the most cringeworthy TikTok ever. How do people even watch that? But honestly, it’s kind of entertaining in a trainwreck sort of way. Rizz is everywhere these days, like everyone’s trying to be too cool. Skibidi for sure, though—those sound like made-up words but somehow they’re legit now.  

Oh my gosh, did you hear about the new TikTok trend where people just say 'NPC' and it implies their friends are background characters in their life? So relatable, right? And don’t even get me started on ‘Babygirl’ trends. It’s like adults are just living in a never-ending Gen Z phase.  

Texting my friend earlier, I said ‘Pressing,’ and she was like ‘What?’ and I had to explain it’s from that viral sound byte. Now everyone’s using it to be dramatic about their day. Honestly, it’s exhausting but also kind of funny how these sounds take over.  

The worst part is when people start glazing—like when they’re so into a trend for like two seconds before moving on to the next one. You can’t keep up with it, but you don’t want to miss out either. It’s all about staying ahead in the TikTok algorithm game, right?  

And don’t even get me started on ‘Him’ or ‘Her.’ It’s like everyone’s relationship status is now a viral sound effect. ‘Situationship’ is the worst because it’s not a real thing but somehow it’s expected to know what one is. Ugh, Gen Z life is so confusing yet so entertaining to watch."

My friend was like, "Hey, did you see that TikTok trend about Gyatt?" I was like, "Who even knows," but then we ended up watching hours of videos about Rizz and Skibidi challenges.  

We were at school and someone brought up Sigma for the fifth time, and honestly, it got so cringey but also kinda fun to watch. Fanum Tax was everywhere, like everyone had a new inside joke about it.  

The teacher tried to talk about Ohio, but no one could focus because we were all still recovering from the Gyatt viral video. Edge, like, became our go-to way of describing something super lit or flex-worthy.  

I caught my crush staring at me with those watery eyes and immediately thought they were glazing me. I wasn’t sure if it was love or just Glazing Mode activated.  

We spent hours maxxing out our snap stories, trying to get Chungus-level vibes. Situationships became the new normal, where we were all like, "UWU" in texts but never made it official.
Gyatt, why you always gotta be so extra?  
Rizz harder, bro, I'm feeling some type of way.  
Skibidi, are you even from around here?  
Sigma, you gotta chill out, it's just a meme.  
Fanum Tax, where did you get that money from?  
Ohio, you the one with the big mouth.  
Edge, do you always have to be so dramatic?  
Babygirl, stop playing with my feelings like that.  
Bussin, let's go somewhere quiet.  
NPC, why you acting so robotic?  
Glazing, you gotta slow down, it's not that serious.  
Lore, you always got the wildest stories.  
Maxxing, are you trying to flex right now?  
Chungus, where did you get that from?  
Situationship, this is getting too complicated.  
Delulu, why you always adding drama?  
Grindset, you gotta stop focusing so much on school.  
Pressing, calm down, it's just a game.  
High Key, you always gotta be the cool one.  
Pookie, stop with the cute vibes.  
Mewing, you gotta quit being so innocent.

"Dude, she rizzed me so hard I couldn’t even respond. Just kidding, NPC levels are real tho."

"Why is my friend always saying 'Skibidi'? Like, does it mean something specific or nah?"

"My group chat is full of Sigma energy right now—everyone's trying to outdo each other with flexes."

"UWU is the best reaction for when someone’s being extra cute or soft. Just saying."

"He’s been maxxing out in the group chats with his 'big mood' and it’s honestly exhausting."

"We were just chilling, then he pulled up with the 'pressing' energy because I was late AF."

"Babygirl stuff is so trendy right now, but also kinda cringe when they tag you in their 'mewing' posts."

"The situation ship is getting too toxic—definitely a 'delulu' energy from both sides."

"We’re all grindseting on FOMO until the next big thing drops. No cap."

"Some people are just NPCs in group chats, spitting out generic responses. Bruh."

"I’m over it. The 'pressing' is real, but I need a 'glazing' to calm down."

"My friends are out here 'maxxing' at the gym while I’m still figuring out how to use TikTok filters."

"OMG, did you hear about the 'situation'? It’s like a 'fanum tax' situation. Duh."


"Yo, did you ever see that TikTok about Gyatt? Like, when he just pops off randomly and everyone’s like ‘What was that?’ but no one really knows."  
"I’m such a Rizz. Like, I’ll just be minding my business, and then boom, I’ll say something super smooth and everyone’s like ‘How does he do that?"  
"Skibidi season is lit! Every time it hits, I’m just vibing with my crew, blasting the song, and being extra."  
"Some people just don’t get it. Like, Sigma levels are real, and not everyone’s on the same wavelength."  
"You ever been in a situationship? Like, that’s when you’re friends but also kinda more, right? It’s like that limbo zone."

"Grindset is real. When your brain’s just like ‘I’ll do it later’ but then you end up cramming till 2 AM."  
"Pressing hard on High Key vibes. Like, you know what I mean? That’s the energy we’re bringing every time."  
"Pookies out here, looking like they own the place, and you’re just there nodding like ‘Yeah, got it.’"  
"Mewing soft for FAWx is such a flex. Like, come at me if you think you can handle this."  
"UWU is the ultimate flex. You know what I’m saying? It’s like owning your own brand of extra."
I’m just trying to Rizz everyone but my brain is melting like a Glazing in the sun.  
My friend is so into this new TikTok trend where you say "Skibidi" and do some weird dance. I’m like, "Edge or not, I can't keep up!"  
This whole "Situationship" with my ex is giving me literal headaches. It’s like a "Delulu" situation but not in a good way.  
I was trying to be cool at the party but everyone was just saying "NPC" and I felt so out of place. What even is an NPC anymore?  
This is why I’m constantly maxxing, like, "Maxxing and Chilling." It’s the only way to keep up with these trends.  
My brain is honestly just grindi-seting 24/7 now. From "Babygirl" this to "Mewing" that, I’m losing my mind.  
I don’t even know what a "Pressing" is anymore. One minute it’s cool, the next minute it’s not.  
This whole "High Key" life is exhausting. It’s like, "Pookie" this or "UWU" that. I can’t keep up!  
I’m over this "Glazing" phase already. Give me a break, my brain can’t handle anymore meta references.  
I’m just here trying to "Rizz" the algorithm but honestly, it’s not working out.
Sure! Here's a dataset with natural phrases containing the provided slang words:

"Yo, did you see that TikTok? That was so rizz, like pure energy vibes, man."  
"Skibidi season is here, and I’m already glazing over it!"

"Relationships are lit AF right now—Situationship goals, y’know?"  
"Delulu for days, but also, can we stop and admire the grindset somewhere?"  

"Maxxing out on snacks while my maxxing out on TikTok—good times." 
Keep in mind this is a creative example and should be adjusted as needed!
gyatt rizz skibidi sigma fanum tax ohio edge babygirl bussin npc glazing lore maxxing chungus situationship delulu grindset pressing high key pookie mewing uwu

"Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend? It’s all about Gyatt-ing your friends and making them say 'Oof' nonstop. My DMs were flooded with Rizz comments earlier, so I had to mute everyone to focus on my grueling homework. Skibidi is defs the vibe right now—everyone’s decked out in anime merch and quoting Lore like it’s their spirit animal. Sigma levels are through the roof at school, and I’m not even sure what a Fanum Tax is anymore. Just kidding, I still have an Ohio-shaped scar from when my mom caught me watching Chungus videos at 3 AM. Situationships are the worst—friends turning into strangers overnight because someone called them 'basic.' I’m out here trying to Maxx my summer breaks and Grindset till it hurts. If you see me mewing on TikTok, know that it’s not an excuse to come over. Just kidding again—I totally am. High Key or no high key, I’m living in this Glazing phase of my life."
Sure! Here's another set of conversational text snippets incorporating the provided slang words:


"Yo, did you see that TikTok about the new viral challenge? It’s so lit, right? Like, everyone’s doing it. I’m already on my third video."

"Yeah, man. But honestly, I’m over it. Like, when is there a new trend that isn’t just someone trying to get famous off of their cringe."

"True. But hey, at least we’re living in the age of content, you know? Like, we’ve never had so much to consume."

"Exactly. And the slang is just getting wilder and wilder. I can’t keep up sometimes."

"Speaking of, have you heard about this new term everyone’s using? It’s like a mix between ‘rizz’ and ‘glazing.’"

"Wait, what even is that? Is it another TikTok meme or something?"

"Oh yeah, it’s all over the app. They’re saying it’s the next big thing in online slang."

"Alright, I’ll check it out later. But honestly, I’m just here for the memes. Nothing beats a good viral moment."

"Same! And don’t even get me started on the new TikTok sounds. Some of them are straight up vibe-checking in the clubs."

"For sure. But I’m still trying to figure out why some sounds are more popular than others. Like, what makes one sound go viral and another just fade into obscurity?"

"Who knows? It’s probably a mix of everything—the beat, the melody, how it feels when you hear it. Like, it has to resonate with people on a deep level."

"Yeah, that makes sense. And honestly, I’m here for it. As long as there are new sounds and new slang, the internet keeps getting more entertaining by the day."

"Exactly. And let’s not forget about the viral dances. Some of them are straight-up workout in disguise."

"True story. But you can’t beat the fun of learning a new dance just to post it on TikTok and see how many followers you gain overnight."

"And the comments! They’re always so lit, too. Like, everyone’s trying to be the next big influencer."

"Yeah, man. It’s crazy how one viral video can change someone’s life overnight. Though I’d rather not have my 15 minutes of fame anytime soon."


"I was just trying to figure out if Gyatt is actually better than Rizz."  
"When you're in a situation with someone who's being too emotional about a 'situationship,' it can get pretty 'delulu.'"  
"It was cringey how my friend kept talking about their 'maxxing' and I couldn't help but feel like they were just an 'NPC.'"  
"Pressing for collab or nah?"  
"That video had so much Chungus energy, I couldn't stop watching."  
"My 'lore' is always on point, but this one took it to another level."  
"Gotta glue my 'glazing' when the squad's about to level up."

Gyatt was everywhere last night—every tweet, Insta story, and TikTok had it trending.  
The Rizz was so strong in my group chat, I couldn’t stop laughing at how everyone lost their minds over it.  
Skibidi is the new viral challenge everyone’s doing, but honestly, I’m over it after the first 10 seconds.  
Sigma levels were high in my friend circle today—everyone was quoting each other like it was a competition.  
Fanum Tax is the latest slang, but I’m not here for it—it feels forced and cringeworthy.  
Ohio is the ultimate flex, right? Like, saying “I’m from Ohio” is the easiest way to sound cool in 2023.  
Edge is all about that extra confidence—like when your friends gas you up, but you already knew you were lit.  
Babygirl is so cute when they use it sarcastically—it’s like a backhanded compliment but still melts my heart.  
Bussin’ has to be the ultimate flex—everyone’s doing it, and honestly, I’m just here to see how creative people can get with the sound.  
NPC is such a vibe because it’s like, “Yeah, I’m just here in the background, no big deal.”  
Glazing is when you’re so extra about your snacks—it’s not food anymore, it’s an art form.  
Lore is that TikTok trend where you pretend to be a D&D character—so meta but also hilarious.  
Maxxing is when you flex your skills in the most over-the-top way possible—it’s like flexing your brainpower.  
Chungus is the ultimate meme energy—like, you’re too much for this world, and you know it.  
Situationship is that complicated friend zone situation where you’re not really friends or lovers—they’re something in between.  
Delulu is when you take something cute and make it way too intense—like, “Why am I soobsessed with this one TikTok sound?”  
Grindset is the ultimate flex because it’s like, “I’m working hard, but in a cool way that doesn’t feel like work.”  
Pressing is when you’re so excited about something, you can’t even hold your phone still—it’s like, “OMG, did you see this tweet?”  
High Key is the vibe when you’re chill AF and don’t care about anyone’s opinions—but deep down, you’re just a little extra.  
Pookie is the ultimate term of endearment because it’s cute and sassy all at once—like “I’m not just your friend, I’m your pookie.”  
Mewing is when you’re so into something that you just go, “Mew!”—it’s like a cross between a cat and a straight-up stan. 


Okay, let’s get into it! Here’s a chunk of natural, conversational text filled with brainrot slangs:

"Yo, did you see that TikTok video? So fire, literally, my brain just melted. The edits were so lit, I’m still vibing in the vibe zone, honestly. My fam is always on me about being too extra, but Rizz is real, you know? It’s not just about the moves; it’s the energy, the Glazing effect, the way you hit that Lore and make everyone else feel like they’re maxxing out without even trying."

"Skibidi season is here, and honestly, I’m so ready to level up my grindset. The stacks are stacking, and I’m feeling that Edge vibe hard. My squad’s all about it too—like, we’re out here mellowing in the glow-up, no cap. It’s lit AF."

"Did you hear about the new TikTok challenge? Oh, they called it the ‘High Key’ challenge. It’s all about shining so hard, even your DMs are lit AF. But Pookie mode is real, I’m not even lying. You have to go full-on mew in those videos to get that algorithmic love."

"UWU forever! The internet’s been taken over by the Chungus energy. Like, it’s everywhere you look—situationships, delulu moments, grindset vibes. I’m so here for it, honestly. It’s like a full-on Glazing of the soul."

"Fanum Tax is real, though. You can’t even go through TikTok without seeing those fan theories. It’s lit AF, but also kinda cringe when you think about how deep the NPC stuff gets. But hey, we’re all just vibing in our own vibe zones, right?"

"Pressing on FOMO is a real thing. You miss one trend, and your brainrot level drops by 50%. Like, where’s the High Key now? My timeline’s been shook ever since."

"My friend tried to explain Ohio to me, but honestly, it sounds too lit AF to even process. I’m just out here mellowing in my own maxxing zone, no cap. Brainrot is real."
Yo, did you see that TikTok trend where everyone’s saying "Gyatt" instead of "Like"? So funny but also kind of confusing. I was scrolling through TikTok and saw this video where the guy was just "Rizz"ing everyone—like he had some kind of magic or something. My friend keeps saying "NPC" when we're hanging out, but I'm not sure if it's just them being weird or if they actually think that way. Have you heard about the new TikTok challenge where people are "Maxxing" their lives? So wild!
I need to focus on generating a dataset of conversational chunks using modern TikTok slang. Here’s an example:

"Yo, did you see that Gyatt challenge? Everyone’s been doing it non-stop! I’m still trying to figure out the perfect way to execute it without looking like a complete moron. Rizz is so hard right now, though. Like, can’t nobody pull off the classic ‘I’m just here for the culture’ line anymore without it sounding cringe. Skibidi season is over, but I’ll never forget those early days when everyone was trying to be the next Sigma. Seriously, how does one just… maxx out like that? And don’t even get me started on the situationship drama! My friends are losing their minds over these Delulu-level vibes, while I’m just over here mewwwing about my grindset. High key energy, though, right? The fact that someone invented ‘pressing’ into a full blown TikTok dance is giving me life. I’m all for Pookie aesthetics, but can we please stop with the Mewing sounds in public? It’s getting too unprofessional. UWU"
Yo, let's dive into this brainrot slang session!  
"Did you catch that new TikTok trend? It was Gyatt level for sure!"  
Rizz is definitely an art form—like when you make someone feel like the smartest person ever.  
Skibidi challenges are all about those cringey sounds and awkward vibes.  
Sigma levels are high right now—I can't stop noticing it everywhere!  
Taxed AF on that new bag, though.  
Fly as in Flywalk? No, more like Fly in the sense of Flywear—so expensive.  
Ohio, man. I’m feeling so out of the loop.  
Edge is all over her outfit—so chic, so trendy!  
"Hey Babygirl, let's grab lunch!"  
That concert was Bussin’ on another level.  
He’s been acting like an NPC in our group chat—all nods and no real input.  
Glazing is the new trend—glitter everything, stat!  
That fan theory was pure Lore—so detailed, so convincing!  
Let’s Maxxing this weekend—I’ve got big plans.  
I Chungus’d my own living room with that surprise.  
We’re in a Situationship—casual, but always fun.  
She’s been Delulu lately, crying over everything.  
Grindset mode activated—no distractions!  
Pressing for snacks because I’m starving!  
She’s the High Key of the group—so stylish, so ahead.  
Why you Pookie me?!"  
"Get lost, it’s just Mewing over these cute cat memes!"
I’m totally vibing with my friend’s new TikTok account—she’s all about "Glazing" these viral videos. Have you seen her latest? It’s been "Maxxing" views nonstop! We’re trying to get our "Situationship" right, but honestly, it’s just so "Delulu" sometimes.  

I’m so over my math class—it’s all "Pressing" me already. But my dude is always saying I’m his "Babygirl," which is kinda sick. We’ve been crashing the "Skibidi" trend and it’s becoming a must-see.  

OMG, you have to check out this new challenge called "Chungus." It’s so "Grindset," but in the best way. My crush keeps sending me these "UWU" texts—like, seriously, it’s melting my brain.  

I’m always trying to "Rizz" my friends into watching these viral videos, but no one’s having it. Maybe I need to level up my "NPC" status. You know what I mean—being that person everyone just ignores because they’re too busy "Mewing."

"Hey my guy, did you see that new TikTok trend? It’s all about Gyatt and Rizz. I’m literally losing my mind over it."  

"I was just sitting there minding my own business when someone hit me with a Situationship. Like, where did that even come from?"  

"Yo, my friend tried to explain 'NPC' to me, and I was like, 'Is this some new slang or are you just really confused right now?'"  

"She’s been acting so extra lately. I’m not sure if it’s a Maxxing phase or she’s finally met her Pookie."  

"UWU is literally the only reaction I need for everything. Like, 'Oh no you didn’t!' – just UWU."  

"We’ve been in this grindset for months now, and honestly, I’m just here for the Glazing and the lore."  

"My roommate keeps saying 'pressing' every time I ask her to clean. I’m starting to think she’s secretly brainrotted too."  

"Someone told me about this new trend called 'delulu,' and honestly, I don’t know if it’s real or just people making up words."  

"I was maxxing out in the kitchen, and my sis came in like, 'What are you doing?' And I was like, 'This is not what it looks like.'"  

"NPC levels are basically my life right now. Like, how do they even expect me to keep up with everything?"  
"My friend’s been using 'bussin' nonstop. I’m pretty sure she’s about to start a TikTok account dedicated solely to it."  

"High key, right? Like, how does anyone even function without at least one 'high key' moment in their day?"  

"I’ve been trying to get my friend into 'chungus' mode, but she just keeps staring at me like I’m the NPC."  

"Tax is literally everywhere. Like, I can’t go a day without someone dropping it on me. What even is happening?"  

"Situationally, I’m just trying to exist and people keep hitting me with 'pressing' like it’s my vibe or something."
I was just Gyatt about that move.  
You gotta have some Rizz to pull that off.  
Skibidi in my area, though.  
I’m not here for Sigma vibes today.  
Fanum Tax on fleek status.  
Ohio, like, where is the line?  
Edge or bust?  
Babygirl, I’m literally a fan of everything.  
This grindset is killing me.  
Pressing send but my finger won’t stop.  
High Key energy, can’t handle it.  
Pookie, you’re too much.  
Mewing over that aesthetic.  
UWU forever.

MG, did you see that Gyatt got clout? Like, he was chilling with Sigma last night, and now everyone’s asking for his vibe.  
High key, right? Those two are always on fleek.  
But hold on, Pookie was also there, and I’m like, “Lowkey, this is too lit.”  
Wait, Glazing too? The energy was off the charts!  
I’m dying over these memes they’re dropping—chungus forever!
Alright, let’s get into the zone of brainrotted teenager energy. Here’s some text for your dataset:

so, did you see how Gyatt pulled up last night? Like, that move was so rizz. I’m literally shook."

"She had me doing the lore all night. I’m still trying to recover from the Glazing."  

can’t believe my babygirl is already maxxing out. Time flies when you’re in that grindset!"  

"He was like, ‘I’m just here to press and meme,’ but we all know it’s deeper than that."  

"It’s always press or panic in this High Key world. Stay sharp, or you’ll be mewing for good."  

"She’s got that Edge vibes, though. Like, you can’t fake that kind of energy."  

did you see how Sigma shut down the fanum tax last night? Straight power move."

Gyatt was flexing his "grindset" as he talked about how he was "bussin" in school, but honestly, it felt more like "delulu" energy.  
The group was all about their "situation," with someone spitting out "NPC" levels of casual.  
They were trying to be "rizz" at the coffee shop, but it just ended up being "pookie" vibes.  
My friend kept saying "chungus" when she couldn’t find her keys, and honestly, I was here for it.  
We were all "mewing" over TikTok trends, but deep down, we knew it was just "lore."  
The drama in our group was on full "glazing," with everyone acting like they were "maxxing" something serious.  
I couldn’t help but feel like the world was missing a good old-fashioned "pressing," where people actually cared about facts.  


"Yo, did you see Gyatt drop that new single? It was lit af, right? I was vibing to those beats so hard, my brain just... like, zoned out for a second. Rizz is real, though. You know how when you're cruising through the mosh pit at a Skibidi concert and someone slides into your DMs with the cutest line ever? That's straight-up rizz. Sigma levels are high when you've got that kind of energy. And don't even get me started on Fanum Tax—those kids know how to turn up. Ohio is such a vibe, though. It's like, 'I'm just here to have fun and make memories with my crew.' Edge, on the other hand, is all about that 'I'm cooler than you' energy. Babygirl is so easy to pull off when you're spilling tea about your situa-ship. And let's not forget the Grindset—those kids are out here hustle hard and still manage to keep it fly. Pressing is just the ultimate flex, like, 'I don't need anyone else to have a good time.' High Key is where it's at if you're trying to be low-key legendary. Pookie brings out that soft side we all wish we had more of, and Mewing? Yeah, that's straight-up cute overload."
Got it! Here’s a natural, conversational text dataset with integrated TikTok slang:

"Yo, did you see how Gyatt pulled up last night? Rizz was on full display, honestly. The crowd was losing their minds over his Skibidi energy. I’m dead, honestly. Also, that Sigma attitude he had? Too much for me to handle. Plus, the whole situation with the Situationship and his Babygirl vibes? I’m still trying to recover. Keep it real, always."

"Pressing send on that Glazing pic was one of the smartest moves ever. Lore-wise, you can’t beat Maxxing like that. Chungus energy is real, though. I’m here for it. And don’t even get me started on the High Key flexes. Honestly, if only we all had Pookie-level swag. Mewing over those Grindset goals? So relatable."

"UWU forever, right? It’s all about that Glazing aesthetic. Situationships are the worst, honestly. Like, how can you not Maxx out when your vibe is on point? Rizz is everywhere, man. And Gyatt? Don’t even get me started. Too much flavor for one lifetime."
Okay, here's a natural, conversational chunk of text containing some of the provided terms:

"Hey, did you see that new TikTok trend where everyone’s saying 'Gyatt' instead of 'chat'? So funny how it just takes off like that out of nowhere. I’m trying to figure out if it’s just a phase or if it’ll stick around. Also, have you heard about the new slang term 'Rizz'? It’s like when someone’s so confident it’s almost intimidating but also kinda endearing. You know, the kind of thing where they just own their weirdness and make it cool. Anyway, I think I’m starting to get the hang of it, but brainrot is real, man. You have to be so careful not to overdo it or else you’ll sound like a full-on NPC."

This text is casual, conversational, and incorporates some of the slang terms naturally within a conversation.
Sure! Here’s a dataset containing modern TikTok slang (brainrot) terms in natural, conversational contexts:

"Gotta go Gyatt on that new TikTok challenge, it’s lit af."

"Rizz was strong on this TikTok compilation, honestly giving me life energy."

"Skiibdi season is here, and I’m so ready to vibe out with my crew."

"We’re all grindset, tbh, just trying to survive the week."  
"My friend tried to explain 'NPC' to me, but I couldn’t get it."  
"I’m not here for drama, can we all just calm down?"  
"His flex was strong, like he’s living in a high-key world."  
"We’re always stuck in situationship mode, never moving forward."  
"She’s been mewing about her new crush nonstop—it’s kinda cute."  
"My homies and I are here for the glazing vibes tonight."  
"I’m so over this trend, it’s giving me the rizz Wars."  
"Why is everyone still into 'babygirl' like they’re 15 again?"  
"His Instagram is pure pookie energy—love it."
OMG, did you see that new TikTok trend? It’s just so Gyatt! He’s been using "rizz" non-stop to try and get her attention. I’m over it – like, Skibidi with the drama, but not in a good way. She’s always talking about her "sigma," which I’m still trying to figure out. This group chat is lit AF – we’re all just spamming "fanum tax" to keep the conversation alive. That new TikTok meme is so Chungus, you can’t even handle it. I’m trying to "maxxing" my Insta – but my followers aren’t buying it. He’s been pressuring everyone about that viral video – so extra. She’s always saying she’s in her "babygirl" phase – which I’m still processing. I can’t believe he’s using "glazing" to describe his new car – too much, though.
"OMG, did you see that my guy Rizz pulled up with the drip last night? Straight up flexing, no cap."  
"I was sitting there minding my own business when someone asked me about my 'Situationship' and I was like, 'Whew, that's deep.'"  
"My friend kept saying 'Glazing' every time we talked about the new TikTok trend, but honestly, I had no idea what they were talking about."  
"That one girl in class is straight-up 'Delulu,' always quoting Naruto and acting like she's Naruto herself."  
"My squad was out chillin', and someone brought up the term 'Chungus' in a completely random context, and we all lost it."  
"I tried to explain 'Maxxing' to my parents, but they were like, 'What are you even talking about?'"  
"I told my crush I was in a 'Situationship,' and she looked at me like I had two heads."  
"My dude brought up the 'Grindset' when we were talking about school, and honestly, it made zero sense coming from him."  
"That TikTok video about 'Babygirl' making pancakes had me in tears, no lie."  
"I was mid-text to my friend about a new viral sound when I realized I was 'pressing' too hard."  
"My cousin is always using 'NPC' to describe people who don't interact at parties, and honestly, it's kinda spot on."  
"I couldn't stop laughing when someone referred to their ex as a 'Pookie,' like they were talking about a pet or something."  
"The way my friend keeps saying 'Edge' when he talks about girls is both hot and confusing."  
"My aunt tried to explain TikTok slang to me, but I was too busy trying to figure out if she's a 'Brainrot' herself."  
"I've been using 'Glazing' in every sentence lately, and my family is starting to think I'm full-on lost."

Bro, did you see that new TikTok trend where everyone’s doing the "skibidi"? It’s so extra but in the best way possible.  
Oh my gosh, I’m all about it! Like, when they say "gyatt," it just hits different.  
For sure. And have you noticed how people are always talking about their "situation" these days? Like, we’re all just living our best "delulu" life.  
Hah, so true. But honestly, sometimes it’s overwhelming how much "glazing" is happening in my DMs.  
I know, right? And don’t even get me started on the "lore" that’s been floating around. It’s like, we’re all trying to be the next "chungus."  
Exactly! And if someone calls you a "sigma," just know it’s a compliment—they see your dominance.  
Oh, and when someone’s being extra "pressing," it’s kinda cute but also kinda annoying because I’m trying to keep my "grindset" going.  
Hah, same! And don’t forget about the "babygirl" comments—they’re just code for adorableness.  
For sure. It’s like everyone’s walking around with their own "bussin" energy.  
I know! And when someone says you’ve got a "high key," it means you’re just living your best life, no cap.  
Exactly. So yeah, we’re all just out here trying to be the ultimate "pookie."  
Hah, let’s make it happen!  

"Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend? Gyatt is literally everywhere, and honestly, it’s kind of lit."  
"Gotta love when your friend rizzes so hard, you just can’t help but laugh, no matter how cringe it is."  
"My dude was spitting facts about Skibidi being the ultimate flex, and I was like, yeah, we’re all leveling up here."  
"Sigma energy is real, though. You know when you’ve got that confidence that’s just unbotherable?"  
"Why even bother with a situationship when you can just maxx out and make it official already?"  
"UWU is the ultimate flex because who doesn’t love being soft and cute AF?"  
"Pressing too hard on TikTok is basically asking for a 10/10, so better make sure your content is fire."  
"My girl’s been glazing non-stop, and honestly, it’s giving major FNF vibes."  
"High key energy is the only way to survive these algorithms. Low key is just begging to get ghosted."  
"You can’t tell me that Rizz isn’t a full-time job, like how else would you keep up with all the levels?"  
"Babygirl energy is everything, but also, when do we finally admit that it’s just as addicting as Candy Crush?"  
"Bussin’ harder than a PowerPoint presentation at work. No flexes here, just pure content grind."  
"NPC level: When your friend asks you to watch their TikTok and you’re just sitting there like, ‘What’s happening?’"  
"Delulu energy is the only way to explain why I’m still watching these 15-second clips that should’ve been canceled two weeks ago."  
"Grindset mode activated. Can’t even enjoy my downtime without thinking about the next viral sound byte."  
"Pressing and scrolling through TikTok is literally what I do for a living now. #JobSecurity."
Gyatt, man, I’m so vibing right now, this is lit af. Rizz is such a flex, like how they just drop these hot takes outta nowhere. Skibidi vibes are strong today, I’m honestly feeling the energy so hard. Sigma levels are through the roof, everyone’s got that extra something. Fanum Tax is mad real, like when you’re on that grind and gotta pay homage to the flow. Ohio is such a vibe, keep it up! Edge is everywhere, people are just straight-up out here. Babygirl mode is so clutch, can’t stop, won’t stop. Bussin energy is off the charts, no cap. NPC is wild, like how they just melt into the background. Glazing is on point, so smooth and consistent. Lore is next level, that storytelling game is strong. Maxxing is lit, gotta respect the flex. Chungus energy is all over the place, such a vibe. Situationships are the new normal, everyone’s in one or trying to get out. Delulu is mad real, like when you’re just living your best life. Grindset is on point, hustle hard. Pressing is everywhere, everyone’s stress levels are through the roof. High Key moments are wild, gotta keep that energy up. Pookie is so smooth, no cap. Mewing is pure chaos, but it’s lit.
Yo, did you see that TikTok? He was just flexing so hard, I was like Gyatt!  
She had me Rizz-ing the whole time!  
I'm trying to get that Fanum Tax going, but my friends won't stop asking for snacks.  
Oh, Chungus, I didn’t see that coming!  
Yeah, I’m basically an NPC in my group chat sometimes.  
High Key! Did you hear about what happened last night?  
Babygirl, we gotta stop meeting like this.  
They were just sitting there, not doing much—NPC levels, right?  
I’m over it—like, Delulu mode activated.  
Gotta grindset and level up or else I’m out.  
Pressing hard on this situation.  
Situationship? More like a messship.  
Grindset till the last minute!  
Maxxing out the energy.  
Lore or not, I gotta know what’s going on.  
Glazing over these details won’t help.  
Bussin’ through life one moment at a time.  
Edge or no, I’m staying sharp.  
Pookie for the win, but let’s keep it real.  
Mewing about it later—count on it!  
UWU, I guess that’s all I can do.
"Yo, did you see that new Skibidi challenge? It’s lit!"  
"I’m just here to Rizz the whole day, no cap."  
"This new TikTok trend is so extra, but I’m here for it."  
"You’re acting like a Sigma today, can’t believe it."  
"My crush keeps sending me DMs with the vibe of a Fanum Tax."  
"I’m trying to be lowkey but these Ohio shoes are calling my name."  
"This situation is giving me full-on Edge levels, though."  
"You’re my Babygirl, but I’m also your biggest fan."  
"We’re about to level up with this Bussin energy!"  
"NPC levels are real when you’re in a relationship with them."  
"This Glazing is on point, I can’t even handle it."  
"I’m living for these Maxxing moves, honestly."  
"Crushing hard on someone who’s just here to Chungus it up."  
"Situationships are the worst because they’re always on read."  
"That’s some next-level Delulu energy right there."  
"I’m all about that Grindset, no flex."  
"You’re pressing me too hard with those facts, though."  
"High Key vibes are real, and I’m here for it."  
"Pookie energy is the ultimate mood killer."  
"UWU right now because my day just got better."

gyatt that’s literally the mood of 2023 okay, rizz is extra in the group chat bc no one can keep up with his lines, skibidi on fleek, sigma when you’re about your business and not playing games, fanum tax for when u know it’s coming but u just go along, ohio like yeah that’s lit, edge as a lifestyle, babygirl for ur bae, bussin in the kitchen, npcing hard for when someone’s just out of their depth, glazing over the drama bc u can’t even, lore for when u see something wild but it’s probably fake, maxxing for those flex moments that no one sees coming, chungus whenever u stumble into a viral moment, situation-ship for when u’re in the friend zone but still hoping, delulu as a personality trait, grindset on the go, pressing for when u need the tea but it’s not happening, high key when u’re vibing harder than anyone, pookie when you’re cute but extra, mewing for those soft sounds that make everyone melt.
"Hey, have you seen the new TikTok challenge? It’s so lit, I’m already Gyatt on it.  
My friend tried to Rizz me earlier, but I was like, ‘Nope, I’m onto you.’  
The food at this place is out of Skibidi—like, fire emoji level.  
That guy over there is just Sigma-ing everyone, you know?  
I’m so over this situationship, it’s giving me stress levels like, 10/10.  
She’s been Delulu-ing nonstop, but I’m here for the drama.  
My grindset is strong right now—straight A’s, no cap.  
Oh my gosh, did you see that viral meme? It was so Pressing, lol.  
This new trend is giving me High Key vibes, like, it’s way too extra.  
I’m over it, like Pookie-mode for sure.  
My cat does this thing where she just sits there and mews at me—so Mewing levels.  
This playlist has been on repeat, I’m maxxing out on it.  
She’s been acting so Lore lately, it’s giving me the eyerolls.  
I’m trying to focus on my work but Glazing mode is real.  
He’s got that Chungus energy, you can’t ignore.  
The way they’re shipping these characters? So basic, but I’m here for it.  
This drama is so extra, like, it’s giving me ‘Law of Attraction’ vibes."
Gyatt me, that's lit.  
Skibidi as much as possible.  
Rizz harder, please.  
I'm sitting here like a NPC when you're just glazing everyone.  
Babygirl, let's go viral together!  
Edge as much as possible.  
Pressing send on TikTok right now.  
Sigma levels are high tonight.  
Fanum Tax my brain, I can't keep up.  
Ohio in the house?  
Edge or go home.  
Bussin' out these memes.  
NPC energy is so strong right now.  
Glazing everyone with those looks.  
Lore it up, but make it quick.  
Maxxing out those Instagram photos.  
Chungus for the culture.  
Situationships are lit AF.  
Delulu for days.  
Grindset mode activated.  
Pressing on those trends like they're my job.  
High Key vibes only.  
Pookie, let's make a TikTok collab.  
Mewing over that aesthetic.

Ayo, did you see that new TikTok trend where everyone’s saying "Gyatt" instead of just "dude"? So like, my friend Taylor was like, "Yo, I’m so Gyatt right now, cause I got A+ on the midterms," and we all just started laughing cause it was too lit.  

We were hanging at Skibidi’s house earlier, and he was like, "I’m about to Grindset hard this weekend, get ready for some big moves." We were vibe-ing on that whole "Maxxing" life, you know? Like, crushing goals and all.  

Then, my cousin said something wild—she’s like, "I’m in a Situationship right now, it’s too lit to be just friends but not official yet." We were all like, "Oh my God, that’s so extra," but also relatable af.  

Also, I’ve been trying to get my crush to say "NPC" when we’re DM-ing, cause it’s just so vibe-y and flexy. UwU she better catch on or I’ll have to level up my game.  

Oh, and don’t even get me started on the whole "Pressing" situation. Like, when your ex is still texting you after you’ve moved on—it’s just too much pressure, know what I mean? It’s like, “Pressing buttons” but also pressing delete on your emotions.  

We’re all about being extra right now, hence why we call it "Delulu," you feel me? It’s all about flexing your uniqueness and not caring if people judge you for it.  

And let’s not forget the whole "Pookie" trend—like, when you’re too cute to handle but also kind of annoying because you know you’re puffy in the cutest way. It’s a vibe, though.  

Honestly, I’m just living my best "Babygirl" life, you know? Like, embracing my soft side while still being unbothered. And if anyone tries to "Mew" me, I’m out.  

This whole generation is just too lit. We’re vibing hard and not caring about what people think, cause we’re all about our own energy. It’s a vibe, literally.
Gyatt the new TikTok challenge—it's lit!  
Did you see that Rizz? He had the whole group laughing with his jokes.  
We were Skibidi-ing all night and we’re still tired from the moves!  
Sigma energy is real, but you either love it or hate it.  
FANUM TAX: Just pay up and stop complaining.  
Why are you being so Ohio right now?  
Edge or no edge—let’s decide.  
Babygirl vibes are strong today.  
Bussin’ in the kitchen with these snacks!  
NPC energy is when someone acts like they’re on a game.  
Glazing my brain with this new slang.  
Lore is real, but don’t overdo it.  
Maxxing out the vibe—extra, but in a good way.  
Chungus moment: When you can’t stop laughing at something dumb.  
Situationship status: Complicated, but always interesting.  
Delulu-ing hard for that aesthetic.  
Grindset mode activated—let’s get to work!  
Pressing send on this TikTok or what?  
High key energy—so extra, so cool.  
Pookie for sure when your vibe is on point.  
Mewing over these cute TikTok cats.  
UWU forever.
"Yo, did you see that new Skibidi challenge? It’s lit!  You gotta Gyatt that move though, it’s so extra. Puke, I’m dead. NPC energy is real, like these people are on another wavelength. High key flexing, for sure. And don’t even get me started on the lore – some of these kids are straight-up glazing. Maxxing out at the mall, no cap. Chungus vibes are strong in this crowd. Oh my gawd, it’s so much to process. Situationships are the worst, am I right? Like, you’re not together, but you’re also not not together. So confusing. And Glazing? That’s straight-up aesthetic. You know what I mean? 🥺 Grindset much? Yeah, we all have one. But hey, it’s all good as long as you’re mewing over the right stuff. Babygirl energy is so strong right now. Edge or no edge? Pookie, I’m over it. No cap, this brainrot is next level. 😅"
Gyatt, man, have you seen that viral video? So funny!  
Rizz is such a vibe, like when you know someone’s into you but they’re too cool to show it.  
Skibidi bowls are literally the best, but I can’t get enough of them.  
Sigma energy is real, like when you’re just lowkey flexing without even trying.  
FANUM TAX! Why isn’t everyone obsessed with this?  
Oh my gosh, Edge is so iconic—it’s like being the cool kid but also keeping it casual.  
Babygirl energy for life, tbh.  
Bussin’ is just straight-up fire, no cap.  
NPC levels are wild—like when your friends act like they’re in a simulation.  
Glazing is when you switch up your style so hard, people can’t keep up.  
Lore is for when you’ve got too many stories that no one believes.  
Maxxing is when you go full-on flex but make it seem effortless.  
Chungus energy is just pure chaos, amirite?  
Situationships are the worst because you’re not in a relationship, but you feel like you should be.  
Delulu vibes are when you convince yourself something is cute even if it’s not.  
Grindset mode is when you’re so focused on your goals, no distractions.  
Pressing is when you’re just too extra about the little things, haha.  
High Key is when you’re living your best life and don’t care who knows.  
Pookie is when someone’s energy is just… too much, but in a good way?  
Mewing is when you make the cutest sounds while doing something totally normal.

Gyatt, like, I was just Rizz earlier—totally crushin' it!  
Skibidi on the grindset, honestly, you’re doing too much.  
I’m in my Sigma mode, flexing hard for the ‘Gram.  
Fanum Tax all day, but my vibe today is High Key chill.  
Ohio, can’t even front about that bag of Cheetos—so lit!  
Edge or no? This season of *Lore* is just too wild.  
Babygirl energy is real, but this Glazing has me droppin' all day.  
So much Rizz in my DMs today—it’s like a never-ending Mewing session.  
Pressing send on the Chungus flex—don’t play it cool.  
Situationship got me feeling like a Delulu every second.  
Grindset mode activated—I’m out for blood, no cap.  
High Key vibes only, or else—my Pookie ain’t happy.  
Babygirl, can you stop with the Glazing? I can’t handle it!  
Rizz so hard today, even my NPC friends are shook.  
Gyatt for sure—but also, this Edge is just too clean.  

Let me know if you need more or different types of phrases!
Gyatt, that's wild.  
Rizz, you've got it.  
Skibidi, let's go!  
Sigma, standing out.  
Babygirl, you're too lit.  
Bussin, can't handle.  
NPC, just a bot.  
Glazing, making moves.  
Lore, telling lies.  
Maxxing, pushing limits.  
Chungus, the meme king.  
Situationship, casual vibes.  
Delulu, lost in love.  
Grindset, all about the hustle.  
Pressing, keep it chill.  
High Key, staying classy.  
Pookie, got the look.  
Mewing, just being cute.

"Yeah, I'm all about it, Rizz! Let's go Gyatt on this!"  
"Did you see that Skibidi trend? It’s so Chungus!"  
"I’m feeling a bit Sigma right now, like my energy is maxxing!"  
"That situation at school was so extra, I’m living for the drama."  
"My grindset is strong today, can't stop, won’t stop!"  
"Pressing send on that TikTok had me edge-ing the whole time."  
"You’re such a Babygirl, always bringing the lore with your stories!"  
"We need to mewwo at this concert tonight, UWU!"  
"I’m so over this Situationship; it’s giving me Glazing vibes!"  
"Dulu is out here slayin' harder than a Mowing."  

Gyatt, huh? I’m literally just here to see your rizz. Babygirl, stop frontin’ like you don’t know where I’m at. 
Skibidi or not, I’m always down for a grindset. Sigma levels are real, and honestly, I respect the Glazing when someone’s on point. 
Lore is wild, though—like, how did we even get here? Maxxing out is the only way to handle life sometimes. Chungus energy is too much, but also too relatable. 
Situationships are the worst, honestly, but that’s just how it is. Delulu every day, and I’m not sorry. Grindset hard, or else you’re irrelevant. 
Pressing on everything because high key, right? Pookie for days, no cap. Mewing over snacks is just basic, and we all do it. UWU for the win.

"Gyatt, Rizz, Skibidi, Sigma—these are all such flex phrases, right? Like, when someone uses them, you just know they're leveling up at life."
"Did you see that TikTok? The guy was just *chungus*ing the whole time—it was too funny!"
"I'm so over this whole situation—like, who even came up with 'situationship' anyway?"
"She had me rolling when she said, 'I’m not just a fanum tax; I’m a full-on bussin’ queen.'"
"You know when someone’s just being too extra? Like, that’s the vibe of this Ohio guy I met—straight-up pookie energy."
"Why is everyone always talking about maxxing out their life? Like, isn’t it just life, huh?"
"I love how they’ve turned 'NPC' into a compliment now—it’s like being called a living doll or something."
"That TikTok where he glazes the camera—so smooth, so cool, so unbothered. Just vibe vibes."
"This girl is on another level with her 'delulu' energy—she’s honestly making me question my own life choices."
"When you’re in a grindset and all you can think about is getting to the next bag, that’s realyy *pressing*."
"High key or low key? Like, who even asks anymore? We’re living in a pookie world now."
"I’m so into this trend of just saying 'uhuh' and nodding—like, it’s the most unbothered response ever."
"Why is there always a Lore situation at every gathering? Can’t we just have normal convos once?"
"This girl’s Instagram stories are straight-up babygirl energy—so cute, so innocent, so *chef's kiss*."
"You know when you’re just mewing about how perfect something is? That’s the vibe of this TikTok content I’ve been binging."

Let me know if you'd like more examples or any adjustments!
Gyatt, brah, what’s up? I’m so ready for this weekend, Rizz-ing all night. Did you see those Skibidi levels last week?  Oh my gosh, someone’s being too extra with the Glazing. I’m over it. Why is everyone Maxxing me about my outfit? Ugh, just give me a break. My Situationship is literally dead AF right now. Can’t feel anything but Delulu vibes. Oh no, did I Grindset too hard today? My brain is melting. Pressing on everything because High Key stuff only. My Pookie was feeling extra, mewing all over the place. NPC energy is real, man. It’s like Lore wrote the book on being vague. Chungus, just stop with the awkward compliments. My babygirl is out here slayin’ harder than ever. Bussin’ in every way possible. Fanum Tax? Yeah, I’m too poor for that. Edge or not, Ohio is where it’s at.
gyatt honestly, i've been so busy with school and stuff, but i found this new app called skibidi and it's just so lit  
rizz man, did you see how she was looking at him? like, straight up glazing levels  
sigma, i'm not lying, this new trend is going to blow up big time  
fanum tax, honestly, i can't believe people are still rizzing over that old thing  
ohio, yeah, it's been wild, but i'm here for the drama  
edge, like, you have no idea how much i've been maxxing lately  
babygirl, we need to get this figured out, like now  
bussin, honestly, i can't even handle this anymore

lore, man, it's all about the grindset these days  
maxxing, yeah, you know what i mean

pressing, man, you have no idea  
high key, yeah, that's the vibe  
pookie, honestly, i don't know what to do  
mewing, ugh, it's so frustrating

"Man, I'm so Rizz right now because my ex keeps tagging me in their new TikTok videos and I can't even do anything about it. Like, why am I stuck in their algorithm?  
I heard about this new slang called 'Gyatt'—it's like when you're so extra but you don't realize it. My friends always call me out for using it too much, but hey, it's fun!  
Skibidi is when your crush slides into your DMs with the cutest comments, and you just can't resist responding. It's basically code for 'I'm smitten.'  
Sigma is that feeling when you're too cool for anyone else to handle. Like, you know what I mean—those people who act like they're out of everyone's league.  
Fanum Tax is when your friend insists on explaining every TikTok reference to you like you've never seen it before, even though you've probably seen it a million times.  
'Ohio' is this viral TikTok sound that gets stuck in your head no matter how hard you try to forget it. It's like an anthem for Gen Z.  
Edge is when someone's acting just a little too extra but still manages to look cooler than everyone else. You know the type—people who can pull off anything and make it look effortless.  
Babygirl is that term your crush uses to describe you, making you feel both cute and annoyed at the same time.  
Bussin' is when you're so busy thinking about your next TikTok move that you forget to reply to your friend's text. Priorities, right?  
NPCs are those people who just exist in your life without really contributing anything memorable. Like, they're there but you can't even remember their name after a while.  
Glazing is when you're so stuck on a TikTok trend that you can't stop talking about it, and your friends are just waiting for the perfect moment to roast you about it.  
Lore is when your friend starts spouting random facts from TikTok videos, and you're like, 'Where did you even get this information?'  
Maxxing is when you try to flex your style but end up looking a little too tries, making everyone crack jokes about how extra you are.  
Chungus is that one viral sound that gets stuck in your head for days on end, turning you into a walking playlist.  
Situationship is the phase where you're not quite friends and not quite dating, but it's way more complicated than both.  
Delulu is when you convince yourself that a minor TikTok interaction means something way bigger than it actually does.  
Grindset is when you're so focused on your TikTok career that you forget to eat or sleep, and your friends are like, 'When's the last time you ate?'  
Pressing is when someone is really pushing for a TikTok collab but you're just over it, and you're hoping they'll get the hint.  
High Key is when you post something so fire that even your crush is like, 'Wow, that was lit.'  
Pookie is that cute little nickname your friend has for you, making you feel all sorts of soft but also a bit guilty for not being as cool as they think.  
Mewing is when you send a text that's just a string of cat noises because you can't even come up with a real response, and your friends are judging you hard.  
UWU is the ultimate flex, letting everyone know you're living your best life without saying it outright."

"I’m just here vibing, trying to find my next TikTok viral moment. Did you see that skibidi challenge? I’m still recovering from the rizz."  
"Gotta love when your crush starts using too much sigma energy in group chats. Like, ‘I’m not trying to be drama-free,’ which is basically a full-on flex."  
"UWU is so iconic. Anyone saying otherwise is definitely in denial. Pookies and babygirls are just living their best lives."  
"Why am I always the one initiating these situationships? I’m not a fan of emotional rollercoasters, but here we are."  
"High key, that bread video was pure gold. Why isn’t everyone obsessed with it? It’s like the glue that holds our generation together."  
"Pressing send on TikTok is such a power move. One scroll and you’re addicted for life. But hey, at least we’re not Grindset about it."  
"Sitting here trying to decide between Lore or Chungus. Both are iconic, but I’m leaning towards Lore because it feels more… intellectual?"  
"Delulu much? You can’t just throw ‘spill the tea’ into a conversation without expecting a full-blown interrogation."  
"If you’re not mewing over that viral cat video, you’re really missing out. High key, where is my fandom tax?"  
"It’s basically impossible to not maxxing out on TikTok trends. You’re either all in or all out."  

"Yo, did you see that TikTok trend with Gyatt? It’s literally so cringeworthy but also kinda iconic."  
"Rizz is real when you know it, but sometimes it’s just too much."  
"Wanna Skibidi or what?"  
"Sigma energy is everything, but don’t get too carried away."  
"Fanum Tax when you’re like ‘why are we still talking about this’."  
"Yo, stop with the Ohio references—nobody gets that anymore."  
"Edge cases are the best cases."  
"Babygirl for life, no debate."  
"The grindset is real, but you gotta balance it with some mewing now and then."  
"Pressing send on TikTok is the ultimate flex."  
"High key vibes only, pls."  
"Pookie, like, who even knows anymore?"  
"Mewwwwwwwwww, it’s just so cute."  

Gyatt, bro, I’m so rizzulous right now. Like, can’t even focus on this grindset cause I’m just too into these TikTok trends. Oh my gosh, the algorithm is extra glazing today, it’s giving me whiplash. My situmationship is getting too spicy, I’m like, "High key, where did that come from?" Mew, so cute! My edge is so sharp, I could slice through this loaf of bread we’re all crunching on. Don’t even get me started on the NPC energy in this group chat—it’s literally giving me life, or should I say, it’s pooking me in the heart.
"Did you see that TikTok compilation? So Gyatt."  
"Why was I Rizz earlier? Oh, I was just in my zone!"  
"Skibidi season is here, and honestly, I’m so ready."  
"I’m not Sigma right now, sorry, but my patience is thinning."  
"My Babygirl energy is hitting different today."  
"The vibe was too high key for words."  
"When you’re Rizzin’ in the kitchen while cooking, it’s just pure magic."  
"Fanum Tax, though? I don’t even know what that means half the time."  
"Oh my gosh, that Ohio guy is giving me life!"  
"I’m trying to glaze the keyboard with how cute this TikTok is."  
"Why am I so Sigma right now? Let’s just go with it."
"Yo, did you see that TikTok? That was straight-up 'Gyatt.' Like, so lit af, I couldn't stop watching it!"  

"I'm pretty sure he's just trying too hard. Like, that guy always got the 'NPC' energy—acting like he's not aware of his ownexistence."  

"My homie been on a 'Grindset' lately, always talking about how they're changing the world but still hitting up their go-to spot after school."  

"She’s been acting so 'Babygirl' in front of her crush. Like, always got that soft glow-up aesthetic going on."  

"Someone said 'Chungus' and I was like, 'For Swooool, the keyboard warriors are out in full force today.'"  

"We’ve been in this 'Situationship' for weeks now, and honestly, it’s getting more confusing with each pass."  

"I can’t believe she’s still into that whole 'Delulu' phase. Like, come on, you’re in college!"  

"He was flexing his ‘Pressing’ game hard last night—yeah, I saw the tweets about him getting all social media famous for no reason."  

"My friend tried to explain why Gen Z is so obsessed with these viral sounds like 'UWU.' She said it’s because we’ve collectively lost our minds."  

"It’s wild how TikTok slang just completely consumes your brain after a while. Like, you start thinking in 'Glazing'—where every sentence ends with 'glaze' or something."  

"Have you heard about the new trend of adding '-ing' to random words? Like, 'Pressing,' 'Maxxing,' it’s so chaotic but also kind of hilarious."  

"I’m over here trying to keep up with these TikTok terms, and honestly, my brain feels like it’s melting into a puddle of 'Lore.'"
Did you just Gyatt in the kitchen? That's straight up Rizz material.  
I'm too Big Mood for this, like full-on Babygirl energy.  
The way he just Skibidi me in front of everyone? Unforgettable.  
Stop with the Ohio already—my timeline can't handle it.  
He’s just Edge, pretending to be chill but secretly a hot mess.  
I’m not here for your Situationship drama—let’s get out.  
His Delulu energy is strong, but I'm not falling for it.  
The Grindset is real when you're trying to keep up with TikTok trends.  
Pressing send on that Glazing pic? Extra AF.  
"High Key" or not, that sunset was straight fire.  
"Pookie" mode activated—can't stop, won't stop.  
Mewing over that cute cat video? Basic but relatable.  
UWU is the ultimate flex when you don’t want to be too cool.  
Sigma levels are high when you know your worth.

"Gyatt was always the move at parties, everyone was doing it. Rizz was more of a vibe though, like when he just stood there with that confident swag. 
Skibidi had the trendiest merch, I wish I could've snagged one of those hoodies. Sigma for sure, she never played around with that energy, always knew exactly what to do.
Fanum Tax was the group chat rule we all followed, no exceptions. Ohio was lit at the cookout, grilling and everything, it was so High Key vibes. 
Edge had the crowd going wild, Babygirl was the ultimate flex in her little outfit—so Pookie, that’s just straight Mewing level. 
The Glazing was on point, everyone was trying to copy it, but only Lore could pull it off without looking basic.
Maxxing was the go-to when you wanted to shut down the haters, Chungus had the viral moment we all needed. 
Situationships were the talk of the town, Delulu had a way of making everything dramatic yet relatable. 
Grindset was real, that’s why she killed it in school—Pressing was just her flow, no big deal.
High Key stuff was always on point, Pookie made me Mew with how adorbs he was. 
Glazing again, but this time with a twist, Lore had a way of making even the most basic things feel legendary. Maxxing wasn’t just a phrase, it was a mindset. 
Chungus moment after all, the internet couldn't handle it. Situationships were the best because you never knew where it would go—Delulu turned it into art. 
Grindset was everything, Pressing was just the cherry on top."

Gyatt: When you see a viral trend that’s been blowing up your feed faster than a TikTok challenge gone viral.  
Rizz: That smooth, buttery confidence that makes you feel like you could slide into any DMs and have them melting like ice in the sun.  
Skibidi: That moment when you’re scrolling through TikTok at 3 AM and suddenly you’re ordering a Skibidi from the menu of a random food spot you’ve never been to before.  
Sigma: That vibe you get when someone’s acting too cool for school but deep down, they’re just trying to keep up with the Joneses.  
Fanum Tax: When your friend charges you $10 to hang out because they “don’t want to spend money” but you know they’re just flexing their "friend tax."

"Ever been in a grindset so heavy that you just want to quit but can't? Yeah, that's my life."

"Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend? Gyatt is literally everywhere now."
"I’m so Rizz, I don’t even know how to handle it sometimes."
"Skibidi for life! That’s all anyone’s talking about."
"Sigma energy is real, and we’re not having it."
"Fanum Tax? Nah, that’s too extra."
"We were on a vibe, but then it just Ohio’d out."
"Edge cases are the best cases, right?"
"She’s my Babygirl, no cap."
"Bussin’ energy is lit AF."
"NPC levels are so low-key impressive."
"Glazing everything in sight."
"Lore has such flex, though."
"Maxxing out on flexes, as always."
"Chungus for the win!"
"Situationships are the real deal."
"Delulu? Nah, that’s too much."
"Grindset is the vibe I’m going with today."
"Pressing all the right buttons."
"High Key moments are always unforgettable."
"Pookie makes everything cooler."


"Yo, did you see that TikTok where the guy was vibing with a water bottle? So Gyatt."
"My friend keeps saying 'Rizz' every time I try to be casual. It's so much."
"I can't get over how my dad still doesn’t understand 'NPC.' He’s clueless."
"That meme about the dog with glasses—so 'Lore' for real."
"My group chat is lit, everyone’s using 'Chungus' and 'Babygirl' non-stop."
"I was trying to use 'Maxxing' but my friend kept saying 'Delulu,' so I had to switch up."
"This TikTok sound is iconic—it's a mix of 'Situation' and 'Fanum Tax.' So classic."
"My teacher just called me out with, 'You’re really working hard, are you 'Grindset'?'"
"I was about to say 'High Key,' but my friends said I had to level up with 'Pookie.'"
"That viral video where the kid said 'NPC' and everyone lost it—pure gold."
"My friend’s been on a 'Glazing' kick lately, always talking about it non-stop."
"I don’t know if I can handle another 'Pressing' trend—it's like, when will it end?"
"This TikTok audio is so fire—it’s basically 'Edge' and 'Sigma' combined."
"My dude just went off with a straight-up 'Sigma' moment, told someone straight up no."
"I’m trying to figure out if I should use 'Pressing' or 'Grindset' for my next TikTok."
"Did you hear the new slang? It’s all about 'Babygirl' and 'Mewing' now."
"This group chat is lit, everyone’s been slanging 'Glazing' and 'Lore' non-stop."
"My friend just called me out with, 'You’re really flexing your 'Sigma.''"
"I was trying to use 'Maxxing,' but my friend said I had to level up with 'Delulu.'"
"This TikTok sound is iconic—it's a mix of 'Situation' and 'Fanum Tax.' So classic."

I’m literally so confused why my friend is acting like an NPC sometimes. Like, they just mirror everything I say and don’t have their own thoughts.  
Did you hear about the viral TikTok where someone tried to explain "Ohio" and it was pure chaos?  
Edge or no? My crush gave me a side eye that was straight up glazing.  
I’m in this situationship where neither of us wants to make it official, but we’re both still hoping for more.  
My brother is out here delulu-ing about how "Chungus" is the new viral meme and I’m just sitting here like, "Alright, I’ve seen it all."  
I was scrolling through TikTok and saw someone maxxing out in the comments—literally, they were unbothered AF.  
This group chat is so lit right now, we’re talking about everything from grinds to pressing deadlines.

"Yo, did you see that new TikTok challenge? It’s so lit, like fully Gyatt energy. And that one person kept saying 'Ohio' every time they mentioned their location—so wild. I’m basically living in a Skibidi world right now, no cap."

"Gotta love when your crush starts using Rizz levels straight up in the DMs. Like, 'Hey, you're my Sigma, and I know it.' And don’t even get me started on the Glazing energy of my friends—people are losing their minds over it."

"Maxxing is basically a sport now. My group chat is all about it—'How high key is this?!' We’ve been memes deep for days. And let’s not forget the lore behind that viral video—chefs made it happen, straight up."

"The grindset is real. I’m so over it sometimes, but then you see someone do something legendary and you’re like, 'I’m Chungus if I don’t appreciate this.' Situationships are the worst, though—everyone’s in one but no one wants to admit it."

"Delulu levels are through the roof these days. Like, when your friend says, 'This is my pookie moment,' and you’re just there vibing. And don’t even get me started on how many times I’ve heard 'mew' in a day—UWU."
"Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend where people are saying 'Gyatt' instead of 'Got it'? So random but totally lit. I’m like, why not just say 'got it' already? But yeah, the vowel sounds are fire. Anyway, my friend was like, 'I’m so rizzin’ right now,' and I was like, dude, you’re killing me. What even happened to 'ratchet'? It’s all about Sigma now. Like, 'Sigma or not, I’m out.' And everyone’s talking about their 'Situationships' being lit AF. Ugh, it’s so annoying but also kind of cool how we’re creating our own language. Oh, and ‘NPC’ is the ultimate flex for when someone’s acting extra. You know what I mean? Like, 'I’m not an NPC, I’m a full-fledged human.' And don’t even get me started on 'Glazing'—it’s like when your vibe is so strong, people just know you’re out there glazing the scene. Honestly, Gen Z is just out here making up words left and right, and it’s so refreshing."
Gyatt got me thinking about how Rizz is just a flex, like literally, why do we even say it anymore? Skibidi season is over, but Sigma always stays. Fanum Tax is when you're too extra in group chat, and no one wants to pay attention. Ohio is when your crush ignores you for a week and you just chill, cause you're too cool to care. Edge is when you see someone else flexing harder than you, and you still manage to look cooler. Babygirl is the ultimate flex, like you didn't even try, it just happened. Bussin is when you’re lowkey mad but still hiding it. NPC is when you’re in a group chat and your contribution is crickets. Glazing is when someone else’s luck is straight up cursed. Lore is when you make up the dumbest stories to impress your friends. Maxxing is when you’re too lit, like you’re the sun. Chungus is when you’ve been hit with one too many bad decisions but still somehow pull through. Situationship is when you’re not really in a relationship but pretending to be for some weird reason. Delulu is when you convince yourself you’re in love with someone who’s clearly not into it. Grindset is when you’re trying to study but your brain is just done. Pressing too hard for no reason, High Key is when you’re unbothered AF, Pookie is the cutest form of affection ever, and Mewing is when you purr so hard it’s literally impossible to ignore.

"I’m totally Rizz right now, like, I can’t stop thinking about him."  
"Did you see those Skibidi snacks? They’re lit AF."  
"She’s been so extra with the Babygirl energy lately."  
"My crush is vibe-checking me hard with the Glazing moves."  
"We’ve been friends for years, but sometimes it feels like a Situationship."  
"He’s majorly Delulu about his favorite TikTok creator."  
"I’m trying to get into this Grindset and level up my content."  
"Pressing send on that text was one of the hardest decisions ever."  
"This High Key flex is giving me major FOMO."  
"My friends are always saying I’m too Pookie, but I don’t care!"  
"She’s got the cutest Mewing expressions—just melt my heart."  
"I can’t stop staring at these Chungus memes on TikTok."  
"It’s a toxic relationship but also somehow addicting AF."  
"This Lore is so wild—I can’t even handle it."  
"My aesthetic is very Maxxing right now, you feel me?"  
"We need to collab on this EP and make some viral bop."  
"NPC level flexing is real, and I’m here for it."
"I was scrolling through TikTok and saw the new Viral Video: 'That One Dude Who Just Gyatt'd His Entire Feed.' People were Rizzin' at his Style, but I was more like, 'Okay, who let Ohio into our vocabulary again?' My friend texted me saying she spotted someone doing the Chungus in the hallway—turns out it was just a kid wearing weird socks. Meanwhile, my DMs are blowing up with people trying to FANUM TAX me for some random challenge I did last week. She's been maxxing out her Insta with glow-up vids, but I'm just here trying to not get caught in any Situationship drama. Have you seen the new TikTok trend where people are just sitting there like, 'LORE' because they can't think of anything else? It's so cringeworthy yet relatable. Oh, and my dude is always talking about his 'Grindset,' which I'm pretty sure is a combination of grandstanding and just being basic. Skibidi is just another word that no one understands, but somehow it's become a thing to say when you're confused. And Glazing... yeah, I don't even know what that's about. Maybe it's a new trend where people are just sitting around staring into the camera like they're in a daze? Doesn't make much sense, but that's TikTok for you."

"Yo, that energy was straight up High Key, like you know what I’m saying?"  
"She had me feeling so Rizz, man, it was lit."  
"We were vibing Skibidi hard, just chilling and having fun."  
"He’s such a Sigma, always got the moves like that."  
"We gotchu, my Guy Trippin’ out on that Glazing vibe."  
"Literally, she had me Maxxing the whole night, no cap."  
"That was some next-level Chungus energy, honestly."  
"I’m so over this Situationship, it’s not even funny."  
"Why you always be Delulu-ing like that?"  
"My aesthetic is just vibe checks and Grindset, y’know?"  
"That was such a Pressing moment, I can’t even lie."  
"I’m honestly living for these Pookie aesthetics lately."  
"Mewing over that cute little fluff is just basic."  
"You’re always on that NPC energy, honestly."  
"I’m so done with this toxic relationship vibe, no."  
"Why you always bringing the Rizz to every convo?"  
"That was straight-up Babygirl energy, for real."  
"I’m not here for your High Key life, nope."  
"You’re out here Grindsetting like a pro, my guy."  
"She’s honestly got that Glazing glow, can’t even lie."  
"This Situationship is giving me vibes from every angle."  
"I’m not over the Maxxing energy, sorry, what’s that?"  
"Why you always be so extra with the Pookie aesthetics?"  
"NPC levels are out of control, no cap."  

"Yo, did you see how she Rizzed everyone at the party last night? Like, seriously, where do they even get off thinking they can just come up with these moves?"
"I’m so over this whole situation. Like, why Gyatt are we not just vibing in the DMs instead of talking about it IRL?"
"You know when someone just glazes over you because they’re too busy flexing their ‘Maxxing’ levels? Yeah, that’s always so awkward."
"Why is everyone acting like this is a situationship and not just a regular relationship with boundaries?"
"I’m literally so into this Grindset right now. Like, how else are we supposed to keep up with the fast-paced world of TikTok trends?" 
"That’s basic. You need to stop being in your Delulu state and level up your Flex."  
"The way he just Chungus’d the whole group—like, what even happened there?"  
"I’m not over this. Like, Edge or not, you can’t ignore the facts."  
"Why is everyone always bringing up their Babygirl status? Like, we’re all adults here!"  
"That’s not a real friendship. That’s just pressingly loyal to the point of being a NPC."  
"I’m not here for this. Like, Glazing over something so minor is just basic AF."  
"You can’t sit here and act like you don’t Maxxing at least once a day."  
"This isn’t a phase. This is the Lore, alright?"
Alright, here’s a natural and creative way to incorporate some of those words into conversational phrases:

"I’m just here for the Gyatt energy though."  
"Why you always Rizz me like that?"  
"Skibidi season is *always* lit!"  
"Sigma or not, I’m staying classy."  
"FANUM TAX!"  
"Who’s ready to Edge this situation?"  
"Babygirl energy is universal."  
"Let’s get Bussin’ next door."  
"NPC levels are real though."  
"Glazing it up for the Grams."  
"Lowkey, I’m maxxing out right now."  
"Chungus happen, but we move on."  
"This situ is a relationship, no?"  
"Delulu until the end of time."  
"Grindset mode activated."  
"I’m pressed AF over here."  
"High Key vibes only."  
"Pookies are the best kept secret."  
"Mewing over this mood."  
"UWU forever!"  

"Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend? It's all about being 'High Key' and flexing your 'Edge.' You gotta be 'Rizz' though to pull it off."  
"My friend is so into 'Maxxing,' she’s always saying 'Glazing' when she’s hyped about something. I’m not even sure what it means half the time, but she loves it!"  
"I’m trying to figure out if I should use 'Chungus' or 'NPC' when talking to my crush. I don’t want to come off as too basic."  
"The new slang is all about being 'Babygirl.' Like, saying 'Pressing' when you’re stressed and 'Mewing' when you’re into something cute. It’s so extra, but I love it!"  
"You gotta be careful with 'Sigma' though. People think it’s cool, but you might end up sounding like a snob."  
"My group chat is always lit with 'Bussin,' 'Wet,' and 'Pookie.' We’re all about being unbothered and living our best lives."  
"I’m so over 'Fanum Tax' right now. It’s everywhere, but no one actually knows what it means anymore."  
"If you’re not 'Delulu,' you’re missing out on the vibe. It’s all about being passionate and a bit dramatic."  
"The new trend is to use 'Lore' when explaining something super random. Like, ‘I saw a rat the size of a cat in my kitchen yesterday—straight-up Lore.’"  
"You gotta use 'Ohio' when you’re trying to sound cool but not too tryhard. It’s casual and relatable."  
"My friends and I are all into 'SituationShip,' where you’re kinda dating but not really together. It’s complicated, but so lit."  
"If someone ‘Mews’ at you, it’s the ultimate flex. You gotta know how to respond with a ‘Pookie’ or else."  
"We’ve been calling each other 'NPC' lately because we feel like extras in someone else’s life story."  
"You can’t not know what 'Skibidi' means if you’re into TikTok. It’s everywhere, and it’s so fire!"  
"I’m all about being 'Gyatt,' but only when I’m feeling extra. You gotta keep it vibes on point."  
"‘Pressing’ is the new ‘lit.’ If you’re not pressing, you’re just living in 2D."  
"The vibe is always 'Glazing' when the squad’s together. It’s that smooth, unstoppable energy."

"Yo, did you see Gyatt drop that lit move? He was Rizz-ing the whole time."  
"She’s been on that Sigma vibe lately—can’t even look at her without getting lost in the energy."  
"I’m over it, like, "Why is Ohio so extra right now?" My friends are losing their minds over it!"  
"That was straight-up Skibidi energy, no cap. Everyone was flexing their inner 'Ohio' in the group chat."  
"He just pulled up with that "fanum tax" energy, and I was like, 'Who even wants to date right now?'"  
"They were definitely trying to get spicy with the "situation ship" in TikTok comments last night—high key, though!"  
"I’m so glad I maxxed out my grindset this week. No cap, it’s been lit."  
"Pookie energy was strong on Saturday nights— everyone was chasing that 'pressing' vibe hard."  
"My girl was out here mewing all day about her "delulu" level— we’re not okay!"  
"Can you believe he just went full "babygirl" in the DMs? So extra, but so lit."  

Did you see how he pulled up with Gyatt energy but then Rizzed everyone? 
That move was so extra, it had all the elements of a Fanum Tax situation. I’m tryna level up my TikTok with some Chungus content—like, 
where’s that Glazing aesthetic though? My head is basically spinning like a PC fan right now, we’re living in a Situationship, man. 
I told you, this is pure Delulu energy. Can’t believe she’s still Maxxing me like this. The grindset is real, but the Grindset is stronger. 
Pressing send on that High Key flex? No cap, Pookie. Mewing over UWU is basic, but it’s cute in a way. Ohio is lit AF, right? 
Edge or no edge, Babygirl. If you ain’t bussin, you’re just… not bussin. NPC energy is everywhere, like Lore to these kids. 
Glazing everything up with that Sigma vibe.


Bestie was serving cunt in that sigma male rizz TikTok live while mewing like Leonardo DiCaprio walking through Ohio after a cancelled hot girl walk. When the comments started glazing Kai Cenat’s gyatt, she spilled the tea with a deadass grimace shake reaction—no cap, it’s giving NPC energy but make it delulu.  

The CEO of skibidi toilet lore tried to gaslight the chat about fanum tax, but everyone just yelled L ratio touch grass. Someone dropped a bussin copypasta about main character energy, and now the whole fyp is doing Oppenheimer style edits with big dick energy and glazing like they’re eepy after gucci-tier ghosting drama.  

Pookie kept stanning the gen alpha skibidi rizzler meme, lowkey sending me with how they ate that glazing session. Stan said slay period pooh but highkey got the ick when the vibe switched to sigma male lobotomy-core. Yikes, that’s not it—do it for the plot frfr.  

No cap, the sigma rizz Olympic finals will feature Kai Cenat’s gyatt vs. the grimace shake CEO in a glazing competition judged by Leonardo DiCaprio walking NPCs. If you spill the tea on fanum tax lore, you’ll unlock NPC-tier big yikes clout. Sir, this is Ohio—iykyk.
"I’m so FOMO about this new TikTok trend, but I can’t even figure out what’s going on with these ice people. Did you hear about that whole Situationship situation? It’s basically like a relationship but not really one. Snatched! And don’t get me started on Rizz—this guy at school has it on lock. He’s got the vamp energy for days, and his lobotomy-level self-awareness is giving me life. Plus, did you see those glizzy memes? Pure gold."
"Hey, did you see that Ohio trend? It's so lit, right?"  
"Spill, spill! What's going on with this new TikTok challenge everyone's obsessed with?"  
"Skibidi, I'm dying over these moves. How do they even keep up?"  
"L, like, why is my phone blowing up with notifications about this new dance? It's insane!"  
"Vibin' all day, vibes are just everything. You feel me?"  
"Ghosted again? Ugh, why can't I get a vibe on this?"  
"Drip, drip, drip—how do they manage to look so cool all the time?"
"I’m so sick of people asking me for stuff, like 'pick me' all the time."
"She was just 'ice' in the group, always bringing fresh ideas."
"We were just about to 'let her cook' when she came back."
"That new TikTok challenge is just 'hits different,' no doubt."
"I can't handle FOMO anymore; it's everywhere!"
"Be so fr when you're trying to plan something and everyone's input is all over the place."

chungus did you see that new TikTok trend?  
High Key, I was literally on God when I saw it.  
be so fr, that’s just iconic.  
sus, where have you been? That’s wild.  
skibidi toilet, stop playing with me.  
snatched, I’m dead.  
iykyk, we’re all saying it wrong.
leonardo dicaprio walking yeah high key glazing iykyk bussin clout bala ewokie flexing lit spitting facts bussin af
"Hey, are you still mad about that baddie situation? Like, ice, it’s not that serious."  
"I heard she’s been acting extra sneaky link lately, always trying to get under your radar."  
"UWU no, I’m not playing games with you. You’re either all in or not them."  
"That TikTok of the ohio kid going viral had me dying. So lit, ice."  
"NPC levels are real, like when someone just disappears after one day."
"Yo, did you see that TikTok?"  
"This vibe is off though."  
"My squad's flex is so strong right now."  
"Where’s the tea on this drama?"  
"Let me know when we can splice up another video."  
"I’m lowkey in love with these aesthetics tho."  
"No cap, that’s the vibe I was looking for."  
"The energy at this party is just too much."  
"My homies always know how to level up the flex."  
"Big mood energy, I’m not mad though."

"OMG, did you see that? W, I’m dead."
"I’ve been feeling so FOMO about all the trends, but lowkey, I just don’t care anymore."
"iykyk, I’m such a normie sometimes."
"He’s always doing that, W."
"It’s giving me life, for sure."
"Delulu for the culture!"
"I ate way too much pizza earlier, but lowkey, it was worth it."
"UWU, you’re the best! W, let’s go!"
"FOMO is real, but I’m over it now."
"Sometimes I just gotta be like, 'W, this is too much.'"

skibidi bois are out here trying to flex their aesthetic but honestly, it’s just extra. Like, we’ve all seen those cringey TikTok videos where people mew over a cute cat or gyatt in the comments. It’s all hits different until you realize how basic it actually is. I’m over it tbh. Do it for the plot, though—there’s no way you’re not going to include that one viral sound that we all have on repeat. Bogged AF.
'let them cook bro', 'gyatt that bag', 'so bogged right now', 'drip too hard', 'my sigma vibes are strong today', 'flexing my gucci aesthetic', 'yeah hits different', 'keep the gate closed'.

"She’s been mewing all day, and honestly, it’s kind of cute."  
"I can’t believe they rizzed me like that—my brain is just…delulu."  
"Remember when we were clowning each other last week? Those were some good times."  
"The vibe was so lit, I could feel the energy in the room."  
"He’s been ghosting me since Monday, and it’s starting to get ick-y."  
"I can’t stop thinking about that 'lore' she dropped earlier—it was just too extra."

I’m trying to figure out this situation with my friend. We’re basically in a situationship, but I don’t know if it’s official.  
Did you just eat? The ick factor is real, like I can’t handle it right now.  
You’ve got to try this new snack—it's so eepy, you’ll be hooked.

This guy is the GOAT, no cap. Everything he touches turns into gold.  
It was lit at the concert last night. The energy was on another level.  
Our relationship’s been a situation from the start. I don’t know if it’ll ever change.  
What’s happening? Did you just bala? That was so hot, I couldn’t look away.  
This project is coming together so well. It’s like the GOAT vibes, we’re killing it.  
I’m not here for this drama; it’s ick and I need to get out of here.  
We’ve been in this situationship for months now, but I still don’t know where we stand."
Hey W, slay today?  
The ick is real when you try too hard.  
I'm all about that Fanum Tax energy!

"They’re always like, 'Do it for the plot,' but honestly, I’m too tired."  
"This group chat is lit—everyone’s been *fanum tax* lately."  
"My crush keeps sending me these weird TikTok references, and I’m not sure if they’re serious or just being funny."  
"The vibe in this room is so off, I think I need to leave."  
"Stop with the drama already—that’s not how TikTok works, bro."  
"I’m honestly too busy to be gaslit by these online trends."  
"Can’t believe I’m still up editing content for my fans—this is the life, though."

"Yo, my main character energy is off the charts today, honestly. Like, I was just chilling, minding my own business, and then this one person was just like 'W' and I was like, 'Who W?' And then they were like, 'cap.' I was so confused. But then I realized, yeah, it's all about that 'W' flex. You know, the TikTok kids are losing their minds over this stuff, honestly. Like, why do we even have words anymore when 'ice' is just straight-up vibes? And don't get me started on 'let her cook.' That energy is just pure chaos, but in a good way, right? Like, it's iconic. Anyway, I'm out, peace."

It's like a universal sign for cringe but also for camaraderie.

My homie just got 'babygirl' status—she’s lit AF.  
I was vibing to this TikTok when my fam said "let them cook" and I was like, "NBD."  
She’s been spitting facts all day—literally, "chungus" energy is everything.  
"I glazed" that TikTok trend, and now everyone’s doing it.  
They were asking for the 'GOAT' of memes, and honestly, it's "zaza."  
He’s been flexing his "gyatt" moves all over social media—so clutch.  
We were just talking about how "babygirl" energy is the ultimate flex.  
The vibe was off when he said "let them cook," but I had to respect the fact that he knew the slang.  
She’s been on a "glazing" spree lately—can't stop, won't stop.  
I’m so glad I "gyatt"ed that TikTok challenge; now I’m the GOAT at it.  
The group chat was lit when someone dropped the "chungus" meme—too funny.  
He’s been tagging me in all his TikTok content because he knows I'm the 'babygirl' in our friendship.  
I had to agree when he said, "let them cook," because that energy is unmatched.  
We’ve been arguing about who's the real "GOAT" since yesterday—it's a valid debate.  
She’s always got the best lines—like, "zaza" you're killing it!  
He “glazed” the TikTok trend and now I'm obsessed with it too.  
I’m honestly shocked anyone doesn’t know what "babygirl" means by now—it’s iconic.  
The energy was pure "chungus" when he pulled up those moves on camera.  
We’re all waiting for someone to drop the ultimate "gyatt" challenge—bring it on!  
She said, "let them cook," and I’m 100% here for that vibe.  
I’ve been trying to perfect my "glazing" since yesterday—it’s harder than it looks.  
The fam was in splits when someone said, "they lit AF," but I know it's all about the slang.  
He’s the king of "zaza" reactions—always hits different.  
I’ll never forget when I first heard someone say "babygirl"—it felt so right.  
The "chungus" meme made my day brighter—thanks TikTok!  
She’s got the "GOAT" energy, no cap—I’m living for her.  
He “glazed” it and now I'm glued to the screen—it's fire.  
I need to level up my "gyatt" game before the next TikTok challenge comes around.  
The group chat is wild—someone brought up "let them cook," and we’re still laughing.  
She’s been serving "babygirl" energy all week—so proud!  
He dropped the "zaza" reaction that had me in tears—hah!  
"Dude, did you see that new TikTok trend? It’s lit! My 'ratio' is off the charts because I’m vibing with the vibe."  
"I’m trying to get into this 'situationship' thing but honestly, it's just too much for my brain right now."  
"My friend keeps telling me to 'stan' everyone, but I’m over it—give me a break!"  
"This new slang is giving me a headache. How do they even say these words anymore?"  
"I’ve been vibing all day because the energy is just too positive."  
"Can’t believe I’m using 'frfr' now, but here we go."  
"That TikTok creator is giving me such an 'edge' vibe—I can’t handle it!"  
"When did slang get this hard to keep up with? I’m just trying to survive ‘brainrot’ mode."

When she hit different, we were all like 'for sure.'
My babygirl is out here flexing her goals.
Skibidi toilet is the mood I'm feeling right now.
Let her cook if you know what I mean.
Cap, no cap, that's just how it goes.
Honestly, she was honestly killing it.
The vibe was lit, no doubt about it.
I'm deadass serious about this one.
Spilling the tea is my thing, so let me go off.
She's been slaying since day one, you know.
No cap, that's just how it is sometimes.
The energy in the room was on fleek.
Flexing my moves? For sure.
If you see her, tell her I'm coming for my cooming.
Honestly, that was iconic.
Lowkey, I was always into it.
Let's go, let's go, we're out of here.
You know I had to spill the tea on that.
She brought the clout with her.
The mood was just... different.

That person over there is totally an NPC, right?  
Not them, I'm out.  
I was rizzing him all night and didn't even notice.  
"Glazing" is when you're so overwhelmed by someone’s energy, you can’t even speak.  
Why are you pressing me about this? Stop it.  
I’m so boggled by how they didn’t see that coming.  
They’re vibin’ in the corner, acting like they own the place.  
This bag is fire, honestly.  
She’s been spilling all over my DMs with the mood swings.  
We’re just here to flirt and vibe, not make big deals out of it.  
That move was so extra, I’m glazing.  
I can’t believe you’re still pressing after I already said no.  
The energy in this room is so high, I’m legitimately boggled.  
They’re out here trying to rizz the whole squad, one by one.  
This is not a mood. You’re straight-up not them.  
Stop with theNPC references; we’re all humans here.  
I’m just vibin’, what’s your deal?  
This is fire energy, I’m not even mad about it.  
She’s been sending me the flirts and the swag all night.  
sZN levels are high right now, no cap.  
We’re just here to have fun, press less, and vibe harder.
"NPCs are literally everywhere, right? Like, your ex is one, your current crush is another. But this one? Oh, he's giving *major* FANUM TAX vibes. I'm not even mad, just… impressed. #brainrot at its finest.  
OMG, did you hear about the new TikTok trend? It’s called ‘let him cook’ but honestly, let’s be real, we’ve all been there. Pressing send on a group chat with no plan? Straight up slay.  
Pressing to go viral isn’t easy, though. You gotta be giving ‘it’s giving’ levels of energy or something. No cap, I’m dead."
Oh my g, did you see that new TikTok challenge? Everyone’s going crazy over it—like, "skibidi" levels of vibe! I was just checking out this new trend on TikTok, and man, it’s so lit! My friends are all about it, talking about how "rizz" the moves are. You ever feel like you're living in a simulation? Like, this "stan" level fandom is so real, it's scarier than anything on screen.

"I’m just here scrolling through TikTok, trying to find the next viral hot girl walk video. Pookie said I should swipe left on this guy’s profile because he’s literally vibe-ing too hard. Mewing over the grindset life, honestly, it’s exhausting but also kind of hilarious. Like, why are we all into this stuff? Girlboss energy is real, though, gotta respect that. But then again, sometimes you just need to ick and move on. I’m not here for drama, just so you know."
"Yo, did you see how she snatched that flex? Like, she was serving looks and I was just there mofing."  
"She got so much clout in the group chat – everyone was asking her for advice!"  
"Bro, you gotta stop with the 'sir/ma'am' vibes – we're all adults here."  
"My friendSigma always knows how to make everything seem cool but it's kinda annoying."  
"She was super salty after losing a TikTok challenge – I gave her a rizz and she finally chill'd."  
"Oof, I feel like I'm losing my edge – where's my 'oomfie' now?"  
"Gotta admit, that Gyatt move was lit – no cap!"  
"She been spilling secrets left and right, but I gotta respect her vibe."  
"Can't believe the drama in the group – it's so lit, but also so salty."  
"Bro, don't front like you don't know what 'fr' means – we all been there!"


The "grimace shake" happened when I saw the menu at the new burger place – they had a "lemonardo dicaprio walking" vibe with all the fancy dishes.  
She was like, "let him cook," so I stepped back and let my friend take the lead on the group chat about the new TikTok trend.  
"Snatched" doesn't even begin to describe how hot that new guy looked – I was low-key "hits different."  
My friend sent a text: "say sike rn," so I replied with a bunch of crying laughing emojis and a "sus" because the situation was honestly too cringe.  
He was sus about the new trends, but when he wasn't looking, I hit different and rock-slid into the next phase of TikTok fame – or whatever.  
I couldn’t help but laugh at his attempt to do the "leonardo dicaprio walking" meme in real life – it was honestly too much.  
She’s always saying "let him cook," but I’m pretty sure she’s just trying to get out of doing her own part in the group project.  
The new viral challenge is the "grimace shake" while eating cereal – it’s Honestly sus how hard it is, tbh.  
My DMs were lit when he said "say sike rn" and sent me a clip of himself trying to walk like Leonardo Dicaprio – too cute.  
He tried to explain the "hits different" meme to me, but honestly, I was more focused on how sus his outfit was.
Let me Maxxing slay today—so much flex, so little care about consequences.  
Delulu over here trying to start trends that no one actually wants.  
Iced out so hard last night, didn’t even know my own name after.  
Slaying hard on the ‘say sike rn’ energy, it’s too much.  
Bussin’ through the roof with this new TikTok challenge—lit AF.  
Bala mode activated, can’t even focus on real life right now.  
W for wins, L for losses—and honestly, it’s all about the Ws.  
Say sike rn, like, I’m already over here vibing in my own world.

Pookie mode is real—like when you're so into something you lose your mind.  
That TikTok was lit, I was living in highkey mode the whole time.  
I ghosted my ex after she kept asking about my Delulu phase.  
Hits different! That sunset last night had me dropping all the flexes.  
Bestie sent me a text, but I’m still over here Pookied out.  

I was so highkey focused on my Gucci sneakers that I didn’t notice the time.  
She’s been bestie-ing me nonstop, but honestly, it’s just too much.  
I told my friends about this TikTok and they were like, "Hits different."  
My ex is still ghosted, probably because she’s still processing my Delulu moments.  
 Pookie mode is real when you see a Viral Video—literally hits different.  

I was highkey ready for that Gucci bag, but it didn’t even come close.  
Bestie kept sending me TikToks that had me flexing nonstop.  
I’m over here living in Pookied out mode, can’t even focus.  
Hits different! That surprise party had me like, "I never seen this coming."  
My friends are still trying to figure out if I was Delulu or just being extra.  

She’s been bestie-ing me, but I’m just here waiting for the ghosting.  
Pookie mode is real when you see a TikTok with 20 million views.  
I told my ex about my Gucci dream and she just ghosted me without a word.  
Hits different! That viral moment had me living in highkey territory.  
My bestie kept sending me these TikToks, but I’m over here Pookied out.  

I was so focused on my Delulu phase that I didn’t even notice the Gucci vibes around me.  
Bestie sent me a text asking if I wanted to Stan some new group, and honestly, I was like, "Hits different."  
My ex kept ghosting me after I told her about my Pookie mode.  
She’s been highkey involved in my life since we met, but I’m still waiting for the Gucci moment.  
I can’t even focus because I’m still living in bestie mode with my squad.  

"I’m literally about to have a lobotomy for this decision, it’s so hard to choose."
"Sheesh, I can’t believe she just vibin’ without me last night."
"Let’s fire up the chat tonight, nothing better than some fire emojis and rizz."
"That clownery is out of control—I need to call them out."
"I ate way too much yesterday, it was lit."
"I’m low-key just here for the eepy energy in this group chat."
"We’re vibin’, yeah? No cap, it’s all about that vibe."
"This decision is giving me a lobotomy-level headache."
"Sheesh, why is it so hard to get people to stop with the clownery?"
 "I’m about to rizz so hard, you won’t know what hit you."

"The ratio is everything this season, everyone’s been posting their faves."  
"Pookies are out for sure, that’s just basic flexing."  
"Mewing over the new TikTok challenge, it’s all I can think about."  
"Maxxing hard to keep up with the trends, no cap."  
"The fanum tax is too real when you’re low key stan-ing."  
"You gotta give me a 10/10 ratio on this new viral dance."  
"Dude, have you seen how they’re mewing about these viral sounds?"  
"I’m maxxing out my timeline with the best content ever."  
"No cap, the lore is strong on this one."  
"Stan-ing for days over these TikTok creators."

"This video was so edge, like, I can't even."
"Stop clowning around with me, I'm serious!"
"He's been mewing at everyone all day."
"That move was straight-up ick."
"She's the Babygirl of the group now."

"I told you not to do that, but you went full-on grimace shake anyway."
"He tried to play it cool but ended up giving everyone an ick."
"We were just clowning and then things got real."

"That was edge, but also gave me an ick."
"She's been Babygirl-ing everyone, making us all her little babies."

"I can't believe they did a lobotomy on the group chat last night."
"He’s been mewing so hard, I’m like, 'Who even are you?'"

"Yo, this TikTok video is lit! Maxxing all the wayyy. Gyatt, you killed it!  But forrealz, that was fire. I was like 'Perioooodt!' and then we got delulu in the comments. 
Bussin'! You know what I mean? Ate all the snacks afterwards too."  

"OMG, this new trend is so out there, but I'm here for it. Maxxing every single move. Fire af. The way they gyatt in the kitchen—so innovative. I was asking, 'When is the perioooodt?' and boom, it hit. Delulu in full force! Bussin' hard core. Ate so much, feel so good."  

"Ugh, why is this trend hitting different? Maxxing everywhere, even my vocab. Gyatt, it’s all about the vibes. The perioooodt moment was iconic—delulu for days. And don’t get me started on how bussin’ it was! Ate a whole pizza in one sitting."  

"The energy in this TikTok group is wild! Maxxing levels are so high, I can’t even. Gyatt, the editing is fire. The way they drop perioooodt—straight up delulu. Bussin' every move, and guess what? Ate my feelings into a million pieces."  

"Can’t believe how this brainrot slang is taking over! Maxxing all the time now. Gyatt, it’s so easy to get lost in. The perioooodt moments are everything—delulu until you can’t anymore. And when they bussin', you know it’s aye."

"I was edge case scrolling through TikTok when I saw that new challenge. You know how it is—always vibin’ for the ‘vibe check.’"  

"We were all trying to figure out if that guy was just being delulu or actually had a good point. Rizz or not, sometimes you gotta call it out."  

"She’s always gatekeeping about how she’s “on brand” but honestly, I don’t get it half the time. Edge or not, let’s be real."
"Yo, your energy is just too much today, like, you've got the fanum tax going on."  
"You're such a Babygirl for thinking that way!"

"I'm just here vibin' and mewing about how lit Sigma is for clapping back at haters. Honestly, Delulu energy is outta control sometimes, but it's iconic. You know what I mean? 'Let him cook' that spaghetti or that TikTok dance—straight up fire. 😎" 

"Did you see that video where they were mewing and vibin' in the metaverse? So cool! And that Sigma energy when they just shut down haters with facts—it's giving me life. 'Let him cook' those memes though, pure genius."  

"Wanna vibe with me later? I'm all about it. But hey, if you're a Sir/Ma'am type, hit my DMs—I can't resist that energy. And don't even get me started on the Delulu vibes in this TikTok challenge—it's mental."  

"Man, this Sigma is just out here flexing without care. 'Let him cook' those edits—straight legend status. Mewww, so cute! I'm vibin' for days and mewing about how much I want to see more of this energy online."

Hey fam, did you see that TikTok sound from last week? I was "Rizz" the whole time.  

The new school uniform is so extra, like full "Edge." My classmates are losing it.  

I tried the viral "W" challenge yesterday—so clutch! But my friend got a "Pookie face" when they saw my attempt.  

We're planning to crash this house party, but my sister’s "Situationship" with her ex is making me doubt.  

I’ve been on a "Drip" since the holidays—it’s all about the flex.  

Let’s vibe tonight! The playlist is lit—perfect for some low-key "Fam time."  


"I'm literally going to find them and slide through the DMs like 'Not them, I’m Literally Gone.' 
You know you want it—drip with the GOAT energy, or be the sigma that nobody can forget. 
Don’t even get me started on the ratio of people who just 'iykyk' at the absolute icon they are.  I’m out, peace."
let her cook, she’s lit AF  
frfr, my vibe is "lowkey" right now  
babygirl, you know I’m spilling the tea  
gaslighting isn’t cool, keep it real  
ewokie energy is everything

"Ugh, this babygirl energy is just too much. Can't handle it right now."  
"I'm not here to gatekeep your feelings, but come on, rizz is overused."  
"Chungus mode activated. I'm unbothered and delulu for the next 24 hours."  
"L, I can't even. This one hits different."  
"Wanna skately? No, not unless it's with this vibe."  
"This energy is so cult, I'm ready to follow."  
"Stop with the Ls; this one is giving too much."  
"Rizz levels are high right now. Like, where do you even get this from?"
I’m sorry, but I cannot assist with that request.
hits different when you see how he carries himself, vibes so hard with the energy, Edge is always on 100, sigma grindset for sure, bussin' moves all day, 
lore be wild, bestie for life, gatekeep the real ones.

"When I saw that, I was like, 'Touch grass!' You were clowning me for real."
"Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend? My friend was so hype about it, but I was just, like, 'Bussin' or nah?'"
"That new viral sound is straight-up iconic. My vibe though—'Sigma' all day."
"I can’t believe they’re still arguing over that thing. It’s not a big deal, man. Lighten up!"
"This group chat is lit right now. We’re plotting our next move, and it’s going to be so fire."

"ohio, u rlly know how to make a situation lit. ur main character energy is on 1000.
i’m lowkey glazing ur moves though, bc ur high key af. we’re all delulu about ur fanum tax, honestly.
l, stop being so extra with ur delulu energy. it’s cute but also confusing.
i’m over here trying to glaze the room while u’s main character vibes are giving me life. #brainrotvibes #maincharlottaenergy"

"I was just trying to Rizz the group but they were all like 'Stop, you're too much'."
"They tried to play that fanum tax on me but I wasn't having it."

"I'm the girlboss here, running the show with style."
"Gucci season is upon us, and we're all about that vibe."


"Yo, did you see Pookie post the other day? He was straight up vibing in the kitchen with that Grindset energy. I'm so boggled by how much they can turn a regular moment into content. Cap, just cap. Like, why do they always have to make everything into a flex? It's wild."


"Can you believe how sneaky link those TikTok challenges are? You're scrolling through your For You Page, and boom, there’s another one popping off. I’m already boggled by how much content we consume daily. And don’t even get me started on the GOAT memes – they’re just iconic."


"Calling it, I’m 100% sure the GOAT is coffee. Without it, life would be so Grindset. Honestly, I’d mew about that all day long. But no one wants to see a Pookie-like flex from me, right? Just give me my latte and let’s move on."


"Sometimes I’m just like, ‘Why is everything so bogged down with drama?' Like, can’t we just enjoy a cap moment without it turning into a full-on meltdown? Grindset much, huh?"


"I’ve been trying to figure out why TikTok users are always talking about sneaky links. It’s like they’re on a never-ending scavenger hunt for the next viral video. And when they finally find one, they mew about it non-stop until everyone’s sick of it. But hey, that’s just how it goes with Pookie energy."


"Man, I’m so bogged by the amount of stuff I need to do. Between work and my side-hobby of Grindset-ing, I feel like there’s no cap in sight. And don’t get me started on the GOAT projects I’ve been juggling – it’s all Pookie-like stress but somehow manage to keep pushing through."


"Did you know that ‘cap’ has become the go-to response for anything and everything? Like, ‘That was lit – cap.’ ‘I’m so over this – cap.’ Even ‘Can’t wait for the weekend – cap.’ And it’s not just about agreeing; it’s becoming a full-on flex of your personality. But hey, that’s just how it is with brainrot."


"Sometimes I feel like everyone’s living in their own Grindset bubble. We’re all so bogged by our own stuff that we don’t even notice the GOAT moments happening right in front of us. And when someone tries to share a sneaky link, you know it’s about to get real Pookie-like with the mewing and the constant tagging until everyone’s over it."


"Life was going pretty smoothly until I stumbled upon a sneaky link that turned everything into a Grindset. Now I’m boggled by how one video can change your entire mood. And why does it always feel like there’s a GOAT at the end of every viral trend? Just when you think you’re out, they pull you back in with their Pookie-like charm."


"Honestly, sometimes I just want to scream, ‘Cap this!’ because it feels like everything is bogged down by unnecessary drama. And while I’m at it, let’s also declare the GOAT once and for all. No more Pookie energy – give me a break!"

"Edge or bust! If it's not giving me vibe, I'm out. Hot girl walk? Nah, too sus for me. Bestie tried to explain it, but I was like, 'No, delulu vibes only.' And don't even get me started on the W energy—straight-up bogged."  

"Guess I'm just a W now. So sus. My bestie is always gatekeeping my hot girl walks. I'm literally trying to delulu over this FOMO. But honestly, it's all I can do not to lose my mind."  

"I'm so edge right now. Hot girl walk or nah? My bestie is always pushing me to be sus, but I'm like, 'No, we need to gatekeep this energy.' And don't even get me started on the W—I feel like I'm just bogged by it all."

"I can't with the edge energy right now. Hot girl walk? Nah, that's too sus. Bestie: 'Delulu this!' Me: 'Nope, just waiting for my W moment.' And when they gatekeep, I'm like, 'Bogged much?'  

"Yo, someone please tell me if I'm the only one feeling this edge. Hot girl walk? Nah, that's too sus. My bestie is always trying to delulu over everything. And honestly, I'm just here waiting for my W moment."  

"I'm so bogged. Like, where do they get off gatekeeping hot girl walks? So sus. And my bestie is like, 'Just delulu this!' But no, I can't. I'm out."

"Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend? It’s so grimy how they’re all vibing in those viral videos. I’m literally sus about it, though. Like, why is everyone acting so extra? Big yikes, man, this could be another ratio situation. I bet the ratio of people watching versus actually having content will be wild. Glizzy up, or what?"


"Girl, stop being so sus about everything. You’re basically mewing too hard. Lighten up, okay? The drip is real, though. If you’re vibing with the right crowd, you’ll get it. But don’t come crying to me when your ratio’s all over the place. Big yikes, I’m not even sure why you’re so sus about this."

"Man, that was such a big yikes move. Why would they do that? Sus much? No wonder everyone’sratio is going crazy. You thought it was a glizzy situation, but nah, it’s just another grimy trend. Drip off, maybe? Or are you vibing in your own little corner now?"

"Ugh, I’m so over this. The mewing is real, but it’s honestly sus. Like, can we stop already? Why does everything have to be so extra? The drip was good while it lasted, but now it’s just vibes and ratio obsessed. Big yikes, this generation is wild."


"Yo, I’m vibing on this new app, but the grimy content is heavy. Sus much, right? Like, why is everyone so quick to mew about it? 
The drip was fire, but now it’s all ratio talk. This is getting too extra for me, honestly."
"Hey, did you see that new TikTok trend? It's all about saying 'sir/ma'am' to your fads.
So casual, right? Like, 'Bro, can you spare some cash for gas?'
My friend is on a 'sigma' kick lately, always quoting that one video about self-improvement.
Not sure if it's 'ice' or just basic behavior. Anyway, I was like, 'That move was so cold, giving me major 'ice' vibes but also some 'sigma' energy.' 
We should probably do something wild, you know? Like a lobotomy to escape this noise. Let's skibidi and make this weekend the most legendary."

"Did you see that ‘Situation’ in my DMs? It was lit. I’m just vibin’, you know? Like, not stressing about the grind because I’m in my ‘grindset.’ Oh, and she said something about ‘touch grass,’ which was so relatable. We ended up at this random spot with snacks and just chilled. She’s got that ‘pressing’ energy though, always on the go. You gotta keep up with the ‘chungus’ vibes or you’re out. I’m just here for the plot, like, do you even have a life outside TikTok? That’s all I can think about these days."
glazing over the past weekend was lit—my friends and I were vibing hard, had some Rizz, and totally gatekept the competition.  
brb, gonna go Grindset on some lore about the new TikTok feature everyone’s losing their minds over.  
Oh my god, I just saw this viral " Ohio" challenge—it’s so meta, I can’t even handle it!  
I was scrolling through and saw someone dropping pure facts with " Fanum Tax"—too iconic.  
gnm, nvm, let’s not get into the lore of this new app everyone’s obsessed with.  
You know when you’re just chilling, minding your own business, but then someone drops a " gyatt" and you’re immediately in on it?  
I’m over here trying to keep up with the Rizz levels—but honestly, it’s too much for my brain.  
Someone better gatekeep this trend before it dies out like all the others.  
The Grindset is real when you’re just trying to enjoy your coffee and someone hits you with a glazing meme.  
I’m not here for the drama, but the lore is so wild—I can’t stop thinking about it.
When you're vibing with your squad and someone drops "sheesh," you know it's about to go viral. stan culture is real, and if you don't stan your fave, you're missing out. Mewing like "frfr" is the ultimate flex—just saying. You gotta be ready for the "ohio" jokes because that's how it goes. Don't even try to "not them," they'll see right through you.
I’m vibin’ right now, feeling so extra because she’s bussin’ hard. Did you know the lore about how cap people always underestimate these moves? Yeah, cap, like you’re not trying at all. Big yikes, this one is wild. Sheesh, I didn’t see that coming.
"Hey, did you hear about my friend trying to pull off the 'grimace shake' at the party last night? She had us all laughing so hard!"  
"I’m pretty sure my mom doesn’t understand TikTok slang; she’s still using 'NPC' levels of engagement."  
"My bet is that I can do more viral trends than you this week—what do you think?"  
"That guy in the coffee shop was giving me serious 'oppenheimer style' vibes with his intense staring."  
"Have you seen the new TikTok sound for 'perioooodt'? It’s been on repeat all morning!"  
"I’m starting to think I’m the 'sigma' of my friend group—everyone follows my lead but I don’t even try."  
"That’s not a real thing, right? Like, how can you have an ‘ice’ personality?"  
"My cousin is taking the whole 'delulu' approach to everything these days; it’s both hilarious and exhausting."
here’s some text containing the requested words and similar slang, written in a casual, conversational tone:

"i was like oomfie when i saw that new aesthetic edits, they were just so grimy and on point. honestly, let him cook with the best edits out there. ugh, this oppenheimer style vibe is just too much, but in the best way possible. i’m literally mewing over these looks, no cap."

"my friend was asking about kai cenat the other day, but i was like, ‘we’re not talking about that.’ grimy energy is real, tho. ugh, i need to let him cook with the new trends. this oppenheimer style stuff is just too lit, can’t even handle it."

"i’m so over this trend already, but you know, ‘let him cook’ because the new stuff is fire. oomfie energy is everywhere, and honestly, it’s exhausting. but also, it’s kinda grimy in the best way."
"big yikes that move was so extra," "Fanum Tax on point for the win," "sus I didn’t see that coming," "main character energy for the gram today," "L let’s go already," "let her cook and serve that energy," "Edge or go home," "leonardo dicaprio walking into a room with his charisma."
"Yo, that new TikTok trend is lowkey wild but I can't help but vibe with it. My friends are all fanum tax over it, like they're obsession-level dedicated. I swear my roommate tried to Delulu me the other day, acting all dramatic about something minor. The whole thing just gave me major 'main character energy,' you know? We've been calling each other 'sneaky link' because we're always tag-teaming to expose the next viral moment. Honestly, it's both cringeworthy and addicting at the same time. Gen Alpha is out here redefining the culture one TikTok soundrack at a time."
"Man, after yesterday's drama, I was so boggled I couldn't even focus on my skibidi. My friend kept talking about Gen Alpha trends, and I was like, 'NPC energy, for sure!' Then she mentioned something about cooking and I was like, 'Let him cook? Like, literally?' We ended up FaceTiming her dog and it was all high key flexing."
"Yo, did you see that Sigma flex at the party last night? He had us all clowning!"  
"OMG, this glizzy challenge is lit—I’m dead."  
"My homie got "the ick" when he tried to do that viral TikTok. So funny!"  
"W, where’s the bala at? I’m starving!"  
"Sigma energy is real. You either have it or you don’t."  
"Clowning in your DMs with these trends is just… iconic."  
"The W was strong on this new song—he had the whole squad groanin’."  
"Bussin’ out for snacks—literally, no cap!"
Text Dataset for Brainrot Slang:  
"Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend? Like, it’s so lit I can’t even handle it. 
My friends were like, ‘ewokie’ about it, and I was just moshing to the hits different vibe. 
Also, the Glazing effect is out of control rn. You gotta NPC these big brands tho, they’re trying too hard. 
And Gyatt, man, Gyatt is everywhere. The world’s gone full Lore, honestly."
You're just an NPC in my life right now.  
I'm gatekeeping the secrets to the universe.  
That move was so grimy, I couldn't even.  
Maxxing out my Instagram with these edits.  
Let them cook, and let the drama begin.

"This situationship is giving me so much main character energy right now."  
"Why are we always defaulting to 'do it for the plot' when things get too dramatic?"  
"She’s bringing such extra levels in this group chat, no cap."  


"Did you see that new TikTok trend? It’s all about 'spill' in the comments. Everyone’s ‘ghosted’ by their exes but still trying to ‘rizz’ someone new."

"Ugh, my best friend is always using terms like 'not them' and 'chungus.' I can’t keep up with their ‘main character energy.'"

"I’ve been scrolling through TikTok all day, and every video has the term 'POV.' It’s so annoying but also kind of catchy. I’m starting to use it too."

"Someone in my group chat just said, 'I’m not here for this,' which immediately made me think of 'not them' energy. So relatable."

"I’ve been trying to figure out why everyone is obsessed with 'fire.' Maybe it’s because it sounds so positive and lit?"

"Did you hear the new TikTok sound that’s all about ‘rizz'? It’s basically a whole new way to flex your personality, or something."

"My feed has been blowing up with 'POV' trends. I’m starting to think it’s the new replacement for ‘viral.’"

"I can’t get enough of these Gen Z slang terms like 'spill.' It’s like they’re rewiring our brains to speak a whole new language." 

"Every time I see someone tagged in a TikTok, I half expect them to respond with, 'not them,' but it’s actually kind of funny how it’s becoming its own trend."

"I’ve been ghosted so many times, and honestly, I’m over it. But then again, maybe they’re just following the ‘main character energy’ and moving on." 

"Someone once called me a 'chungus' in a joke, and now I can’t stop thinking about how funny it is. It’s like the ultimate flex of self-deprecation."

"I’ve been trying to use TikTok slang like a pro, but I’m still not here for the 'spill.' It feels too forced sometimes." 

"This whole Gen Z slang thing is either genius or brain-rot, and I’m starting to think it might be a little of both." 

"POV videos are everywhere now. I’ve even started making my own just to fit in with the crowd." 

"I can’t stop rereading this text about 'spill.' It’s like it’s stuck in my brain now. Is that normal?" 

"Rizz is the new way to compliment someone without sounding too cheesy. It’s clever, I’ll give them that."

"Main character energy is the vibe we’re all trying to channel, right? Or at least that’s what TikTok makes us think." 

"Ghosted isn’t just for breakups anymore. It’s become a term for any kind of letdown in life. Thanks, Gen Z."

"Not them is the ultimate flex because it doesn’t even need an explanation. Just two words and you’re out." 

"Chungus might be the most chaotic slang yet. It’s like the wild west of internet culture."

"Hey, did you see that video? It was so gaslighting how people can’t believe I’m still ‘L’ about that one time.
 Iykyk, yeah, it’s wild. But honestly, I’ve been ghosted by literally everyone in my friend group—like, ‘ghosted’ is the new ‘sir/ma’am.’ 
 I feel like I’m in a simulation or something. The vibes are just not there anymore.
  And don’t even get me started on the whole 'fanum tax' situation—some people still owe me that favor. But yeah, life’s a vibe, right? Or at least it should be."

OMG, did you see that TikTok trend? It's so GOAT.
I can't believe people are still trying to get clout; it's all about FOMO now.
That new slang is sus; you gotta keep up or get left behind.
Let's bet on who can do more challenges first—GOAT wins!
Her outfit was on fleek, but she had some sus moves though.


"Hey, did you see how she snatched that bag?"  
"No cap, that was lit AF."  
"Yeah, but the situ is so messy right now."  
"Do it for the plot, tho, someone gotta make it interesting."  
"Yo, my pookie is mad extra."  
"Pressing too hard, can't even chill."  
"Where’s the bala at? Let’s go spill."  
"I’m so over this friendship situation."  
"Get out of the way, she’s bringing the flex."  
 "Who let the tea spill?"  

"Yo, did you see that 'sigma' energy in the comments? That was straight up cringe, but also kind of entertaining."  
"Somebody said 'hits different' last night, and honestly, I couldn't agree more. That vibe was just *chef's kiss*."  
"Is it too much to ask for a 'baddie' that understands the struggle of basic white girl fashion?"  
"Why is 'lore' always so confusing? It’s like they’re speaking a completely different language!"  
"My friend tried to explain 'glizzy' to me, and honestly, I’m still not sure if I heard it right."  
"Did you see those TikTok videos with the 'skibidi toilet'? So iconic, right? Just pure content gold."
Alright, here's a chunk of natural, conversational text containing some of the requested TikTok slang words:

"Hey, did you see that new TikTok trend? It’s lit—everyone’s doing it. 
My friends and I were cruising through the ‘skibidi toilet’ challenge last night, cracking up over the clownery.
No cap, it was so funny! But then we got hit with some FOMO when another trend dropped, and we had to do the 'sigma grindset' to keep up.
The plot thickens every day, man, it’s wild. We’re all about that ‘fanum tax’ too—gotta make sure you’re paying attention or else you’ll be left out. 
It’s just like, do it for the plot, you know? Can’t miss a beat."

"Someone’s gotta spill the tea on this new viral challenge,"

"Sike, stop frontin’—you’re better than that drama,"  
"Spill your faves already before I go crazy!"  
"Clowning around with these memes all day—so fun but also exhausting,"

"Stan for your friends, stan for the culture—but don’t stan for drama,"  
"Dude, you’re killing it with the rizz today,"  
"Chungus or not, we all have our moments."


"Yo, Alex, who else had the wholesome aesthetic? Like, basic but in the best way ever."

"Gyatt, this TikTok compilation is giving me life. I’m ready to memorize every single dance move."

"Did you see how gen alpha is taking over? The NPCs are out here vibe-chasing hard."

"Cap, that’s literally what I was saying earlier. No cap, I’m not playing with you right now."

"It’s giving me everything, honestly. Like, the energy is high, and I’m low-key living for it."

"Oh my gosh, Taylor, can you confirm if Gyatt is coming to the meet-up? I’m so excited!"

"NPCs are everywhere, like in my DMs. It’s wild how some people just don’t know when to engage."

"Fanum tax? Nah, that’s not how it works. We’re all basic, but we embrace it, right?"


"Yo, that bag was lit, be so fr.  
High key, she was out there serving looks.  
Let’s spill the tea on this drama.  
She went full slay in that outfit.

"Fire" energy levels are just so high right now, like how does anyone cope?  
She’s out here serving "spill the tea" in the most casual way ever.  
The "rizz" is strong in this group—can’t even handle it.  
I’m over here trying to be cool and not drop the "it's giving" vibes too much.  
The DMs are lit, like, "vibe" level 1000.  
Stop playing with my feelings, Skibidi levels are real.  
Let me get this straight—is "Lore" just another way to say "get lost"?  
And why is the rizz so sharp today? I’m not even mad—just saying.  
If you’re not on the "it's giving" train, you’re missing out big time.  
The "cook" is in the kitchen, and I’m just here trying to keep it real.

NPC season is my favorite time of the year.  
Drip on point, and the eepy vibes aren't playing.  
You gotta stan your girl, no cap.  
This 'Bussin' trend? It's just so... freezing.

Yo, did you hear about the new TikTok trend called "lore"? It’s like those viral videos where people explain weird stuff that actually makes sense.  

I’m from Ohio, so when I see someone say "Ohio," it’s either about the state or some inside joke I don’t get.  

My friend tried the "skibidi toilet" challenge and ended up looking like she’d been to a magic show.  

We’re trying to start a group chat called "bestie" mode, where we only talk about memes and snacks.  

This new glitter trend is so "glazing," it’s basically neon colors on everything.  

If you ever get dumped in the same way as Oppenheimer, you know it’s a full-on emotional explosion.  

She’s been flexing her "clout" in the group chat, always having the next move.  

This new aesthetic is kinda "grimy," but I’m into it because it feels raw and unfiltered.

"hitting 'fire' levels rn, this season of reality tv is giving major iconic energy."  
"that tiktok of the 'hits different' challenge has me crying laug, it's so unboi."  
"why u always flexing ur 'main character' energy when we could've been co-leading?"

"duke on god that’s lit af,"  
"l literally for literally but also like nah,"  
"she’s mewing about her new kitten, and pookie is just here being extra,"  
" sending me, like when ur crush sends u a text outta nowhere,"  
"hits different, yeah, this pizza hits different,"  
"he’s l-ing me again, like we’re stuck in this never-ending phase,"  
"delulu is literally the mood when you see your fave charizard card in the wild,"  
"w, where’d you get that? oh yeah, mew gotchu,"  
"she’s mewing about her new aesthetic and i’m just over here vibing,"  
"pookie, like, came through with the hot takes as usual,"  
"hits different, yeah, this flex hit so hard,"

"Yo, did you see that TikTok trend where everyone was like, 'Oomfie is lit'? But then, my friend got ghosted by her crush—so sad! I was just mewing over my own pet, and she was like, 'Cap, you're too extra.' We ended up scrolling through lore about it and honestly, it was so confusing. Sheesh, why can't things be more straightforward? Like, I was totally bogged when I first heard about it, but now I'm just here for the zaza energy."
I’m spilling tea about the GOAT, honestly. Like, who else can pull off "High Key" energy like that? You know what I mean—those vibes are out of this world.  

Rizz is such a vibe, though. Like, when someone’s just sitting there with their "POV," you can’t help but feel them. But hey, "gatekeep" for real? I’m not sure I’m here for that. It’s like, chill, let’s be honest about it.  

"fanum tax" is honestly my spirit. You’re either paying up or your wallet’s getting left out. But don’t play it cool with me—"zaza" energy is something else. And if you’re trying to "rizz" me, you better bring your A-game. No shade, just facts.
Mewing over snacks because they're just too fire.  
Boggled by how grimy these memes are getting.  
"Opennheimer style" when you know what I'm saying.  
This glizzy is next level, no cap.  
Snatched AF, gotta give it to them.  
The vibe is so off, but the clout is real.  
Ghosting people who don't understand my spillover.
Yo, this is so oomfie! U wnt 2 c the new viral vid? It's lit AF!

My baddie's swag is on point. She’s been serving looks non-stop.

This bag is oppie style for sure. I’m so envy it’s giving me life!

Let them cook, for real. Their content is just *chef's kiss* vibes.

Mewing over my bae? Yeah, no cap. They’re the cutest out here.
highkey, did you see that?  
iykyk, that was lit.  
grimy AF, can't believe it.  
tea on that, for sure.  
spill the details, stat!  
slay, slay, slay.  
pookie, I love it.  
Ohio, let's go.
"Yo, did you see Chungus eat that bread? So lit, man. I'm so salty right now, though, because my ratio is just not hitting."  
"I'm just here trying to grindset and be extra, but the sigma vibes are strong in this area. You feel me?"  
"Do it for the plot, though! If you don't vibe with the current trend, just know that you're the GOAT at being unique."
I’m literally ' W' right now because my Wi-Fi is being weird.  
"Yo, did you hear about this new TikTok trend? It’s basically ' L's."  
You know when you’re just vibing and then your brain just… zaps off into like, ' Pookie' mode?  
I’m in full grindset mode for the rest of the day.  
They sent me a sneaky link to this viral video, and I’m not even mad.  
"Lowkey, I’ve been low-key stanning this person for months."  
I’m pretty sure "doing it for the plot" is now the official motto of Gen Z.
okay, let me just vibin’ in my mind, rizz-ing with my bae about the latest TikTok trends that’s got us all brainrotted. like, "touch grass" when you’re just trying to chill but someone’s like, "pick me," and you’re mfw [mindf*ck], huh? 😂  

you know, we’re all out here doing these viral challenges, stacking those followers, and spilling the tea about everything from oomfie to letting him cook, cause ain’t nobody got time for boring vibes. iykyk, literally, we’re living for it.  

be so fr, like, when your flex is on point and you’re just over here slayin’ in that neon merch and low-key aesthetic, ‘cause no one’s mad at that. touch grass though, when you see a cute doggo or something and you’re like, “let me be that,” but then it’s already passed the window, and you’re crying on the inside, but still, let him cook—no cap.  

yeah, we’re all in this together, rizz-ing our way through life, one TikTok fame moment at a time. peace out, brainrot till the end! ✌️
"Delulu, you're just making up all these TikTok trends!"  
"He was clownery when he tried to explain quantum physics."  
"Kai cenat, man, I can't believe you still don't get it."  
"That move was so Bussin', I'm still in shock."  
"She was hitting different because her outfit was on point."  
"The edge of this conspiracy theory is just too much!"  
"Were you not paying attention? It's all about the Skibidi challenge!"  
"I can't stop, it's like Lore, but I don't know what it is."
1. Situationship with my bffs always gives the best vibes.  
2. My oomfie is out of town, so I'm feeling FOMO hard.  
3. That guy tried to eat the bag of chips but only had one chip left.  
4. Glazing over the TikTok videos until the next trend hits.  
5. He got ghosted after sending too many DMs, so he's low-key shook.  
6. Always bringing that main character energy to every situation.  
7. She got finst from her ex and is now living rent-free in my head.  
8. Can you believe this vibe in the room? It's giving major big mood.  
9. My clout is rising because I'm always out here spilling the tea.  
10. This situation is so lit, no cap—my energy is on 100%.  
11. When your ex says "ate," you know it's a full-blown situation.  
12. My oomfie and I matched on Hinge, and now my Insta is on fire.  
13. He tried to glaze me with his charm but ended up sliding into the friend zone.  
14. If you ghosted me, then you ate—I’m keeping that Receipt on blast.  
15. The main character energy in this city is so strong, it’s giving me life.
I was literally glazing when I saw that TikTok video about how to make carbon copy gucci slime.  
"Hey, did you see that new TikTok challenge? It’s lit af."  
My friend kept saying "spill the tea" about this viral trend, but honestly, it was cringe.  
The new TikTok filters are so extra, I’m already plotting how to level up my aesthetic.  
I can’t stop staring at these TikTok edits—gucci flex levels on point.  
They’re giving me so much content, I’m just sitting here vibing.  
"Stan for" is the ultimate flex, don’t even get me started.  
My brain is melted after watching this TikTok conspiracy video.
touch grass was when ur favorite influencer hadn’t posted in three days  
clownery was when ur group chat started a trend about how weird ur crush’s name sounded  
L was when u sent a text at 2am and then forgot about it by morning  
bala was that one viral soundbite everyone was saying for no reason  
clowning was when ur best friend tried to explain edgy humor but ended up making it cringier  
gyatt was the term u used when ur dog somehow got into the fridge  
sigma grindset was when u finally decided to clean your room after a month of procrastinating  
drip was when ur TikTok aesthetic was "so extra" but you didn’t care because you were having fun
"Woah, did you see that? They were flexing hard on TikTok, like straight up bussin' with those moves.
 I’m dying, honestly, so much spillover energy. And don’t even get me started on the main character vibes—so lit AF, right?"  

"I’m trying to figure out if ‘grimace shake’ is real or if it’s just from that one viral video. Either way, it’s iconic. Let her cook, though—he’s bringing the heat."  

1. "I'm just here vibing, being an NPC sometimes."
2. "My clout is real, don't even try to simp with me."
3. "W, are you even from Earth or?"
4. "Yo, did you see that TikTok? W, the edit was so lit! 10K followers in a week, pure clout. I'm here for the Gyatt vibes though, straight up flexing on fleek."
5. "I can't believe it's only level 1, I thought I was hitting different."
6. "You're literally living rent-free in my head, delulu."
7. "Stop with the 'sir/ma'am,' you're not at your grandma's house."
8. "This simping is real, but someone has to do it."
9. "NPC energy is low today, can't even carry a conversation."
10. "W, why are you so extra right now?"

u rly think i’m just here to be a babygirl? no im so much more sus than that.

"i was just like oh my god this guy is so delulu about his new iPhone but then i saw his snaps and he literally let his mom cook his food in his dorm because he’s living off campus this semester 😂🤦♂️"  
"they say you’re either a main character or not, and honestly i’m starting to think my friend rachel is the literal vamp of our group she’s always bringing everyone into her latest obsession like last week it was Pokémon ruby and sapphire and now she’s onto anime merch 🎁"  
"i dont know why but being edge right now feels so good 😎 like when u say im acting too extra but tbh i’m just living my best life and if u dont like it then u can take a seat 🛋️♂️✨"  
"my dude was straight up clowning everyone in class yesterday trying to be the funniest but honestly he just came off as cringe lmaoo 😒"  
"u ever seen someone who’s literally bussin off their energy? like my cousin’s friend’s sister’s ex is always out there saying wild facts and u just gotta respect it 🤣🔥"
You're such an NPC when you don't know the latest TikTok trends.  
I'm just here for the cap edits on Instagram reels.  
She's been so into vamp aesthetic lately, can't keep up.  
When your FOMO is real but you're too tired to do anything about it.  
Grindset season is here, time to flex those Studyblr habits.  
Ewokie mode activated whenever someone brings up old TikTok memes.  
I'm not cap-ing for this trend, it's honestly garbage.  
Her glazing game is strong, always looking flawless.
Okay, got it! Here’s a dataset with natural phrases containing the requested slang words:

["My friend just called me 'babygirl' because I made her laugh so hard.  
I’m always telling my friends I'm a Sigma because I just love being unique.  
When I saw that viral TikTok, I was like, 'big yikes, that's so lit!'  
She had me with the sneaky link—like, how did she know I wanted that?  
Iykyk, I'm not even mad because it was so clutch!  
I can't believe she did it Oppenheimer style—so bold and unexpected!  
Oh my gosh, that's the sketchiest thing I've seen—Skibidi levels for sure.  
'I ykyk, you must’ve seen it already.'  
'Is this Oppenheimer style or nah?'  
'Big yikes, the drama is so high in this group chat!'  
'Sigma, let’s go! We’ve got plans!'  
'This TikTok is giving me Skibidi vibes for days!'"]
deadass, I’m so lowkey excited about this new Rizz trend hitting different! Did you see those skibidi challenges? 
They’re literally hits different, ghosted or nah. Bet people are either rizzing too hard or just straight-up deadass not getting it.
 Lowkey, I’m here for the flex, but also, I’m gaslighting myself into thinking I don’t care about the drama. 
 Hits different every time someone tries to Rizz me, though. Deadass, it’s wild how ghosted we all get when the TikTok algorithm ghosts us with ads. 
 Bet these brands are rizzing hard to reach Gen Z. Lowkey, I’d rather skibidi than deal with their FOMO.
  But deadass, you can’t deny the hits different vibe. Gaslight me again, and I’m out.
"clownery is lit, honestly. I can't even handle how extra that was."  
"I'm just here gatekeeping while you do the actual work."  
"fanum tax? Nah, that's basic knowledge."  
"Why are you always ewokie about everything?"  
"This energy is hits different, like, hard."  
"Mewing over this is so cute, but also weird."  
"Let them cook, and by 'them,' I mean myself."  
"L is literally the only reaction you need for anything."
ewokie fr  
Delulu always  
Edge or what  
Sheesh another day  
fanum tax 2023 edition  
big yikes main character energy 100%  
not them trying to be chill

I hope this helps!
gotta love when people do stuff like that, it's just so chungus.  
the way they rizz is out of control sometimes.  
don’t even get me started on how salty some of these moves can be.  
uwu yeah, i’m totally feeling this energy right now.  
fanum tax the drama, but also respect the vibe.  
i’m just here for the gyatt energy and no hard feelings.  
chungus or die trying to keep up with their style.  
rizz is a flex, but also kinda relatable in its own way.

"Yo, that move was so Chungus! Like, she just popped up out of nowhere, slayin’ and bringin’ the vibes. W, I’m so ready for the weekend. She was just being extra salty after the W, though—not cool."


"Did you see how Chungus he was acting? L, I couldn’t believe it. My friend was like, ‘You’re so bala,’ but I was lowkey salty because I knew he wasn’t serious. Vibes were high, but also, W, let’s be real, everyone’s got their moments."


"Ugh, why is everything always so extra? Like, Chungus this, slay that—W, I’m over it. But also, bala, you gotta give credit where credit’s due. Sometimes, it’s just salty AF, but vibes are real."


"Her Instagram was lit—Chungus energy for days. L, she sells it all. My guy was like, ‘You gotta vibe harder,’ and I was like, ‘Duh, W.’ But she was just being salty about the W, so we ended up drama-free."

"Bro, that TikTok was straight up bala. Chungus this, slay that—I’m not here for it. L, someone needs to call her out. But vibes-wise? 10/10. If you’re not getting it, then you’re just salty AF."


"Her "Chungus energy" is giving me life, but W, she’s so extra. My friends were all like, ‘You gotta vibe harder,’ and I was like, ‘Duh.’ But honestly? It’s bala sometimes. You just gotta roll with it or be salty about it."


"Yo, that “slay” tho? Chungus energy for sure. L, she doesn’t even know what she’s doing. Vibes are off, but also, W, you can’t deny it. My friend was being so extra—bala much? But I’m just here for the salty realness."


"Chungus this, slay that—W, it’s exhausting. My dude was like, ‘You gotta vibe harder,’ and I was like, ‘Duh.’ But bala, you gotta see the bigger picture. Sometimes, you just gotta be a little salty about the Ws."


"Her "vibes were on 10" but Chungus energy? L, she’s not even trying. My friend was all, ‘You gotta slay harder,’ and I was like, ‘W, please.’ But honestly? It’s bala—if you don’t vibe with it, just be salty about it."

I’m just here for the clout, honestly.  
Why is everyone so pressed about delulu? Like, no, we’re all human.  
That tea got me spiraling into a deep dive.  
The L’s are real, though.  
Skibidi season never ends.  
This “ate” energy is so strong.  
I’m so over it yet can’t stop clowning about it.  
Like, bussin’ with that energy.
I’m sorry, but I can’t assist with that request.
I'm literally just here for the babygirl energy, no cap. Ohio is honestly giving me life right now, big yikes. You know what I mean? Like, chungus levels. 
Stan culture is real, but sometimes it's just too much. Slay or die, that's my motto. She’s literally bringing the situationship energy to the next level. 
I’m so over this; big yikes, for sure. Chill, it’s just some opa style content. Stan isn’t just a name; it’s a lifestyle. 
Babygirl energy is the only thing keeping me alive right now. Ohio has some extra, but I’m not sure if it’s worth the hype. 
You can’t tell me ‘oppenheimer style’ isn’t iconic. Stan is the ultimate flex, honestly. Slay or die, and I mean that literally.

8. "I told my friend a lore last night, and now they're still quoting it."
That was lit, no cap.  
She was giving me the side eye—iykyk.  
I'm out here vibing, oppenheimer style.  
I told my mom, and she was like, 'Chungus energy.'  
GuCCI for the win—snatched.  
You know what I mean? No cap.  
He just flexed hard, oppenheimer style.  
This was one of those moments where I had to say iykyk, literally.

"I've been Sigma all day, just vibein' to the beats and stuff. Did you see that skibidi toilet? 😂 I'm deadass trying to find my glizzy."  
"Yo, hits different when you're spilling over the top of the trends like Gyatt. No cap, it's lit AF."  
"Sigma gotchu on the mukbang, but the lore is real deep. Like, where did that drop even come from?"  
"Gotta be deadass if you think glizzy isn't iconic right now. It’s straight up vibe energy."  
"I'm over here just spillin' facts about the latest leak—Hits Different for sure!"  


"Yo, did you see that video? She **rizzed** so hard, I couldn’t stop laughing. Let’s find out where she got those **vamp** kicks from—gatekeeping all day, huh? Anyway, we should probs meet up later and slay these wings."  

"That guy in class is such a weirdo. He’s always talking about touching grass instead of focusing on his studies. Like, pick me, I’m already too tired to deal with this."

"OMG, my ex texted me again. He’s been ghosting me for months but now wants to touch grass? Whatever, I’m over it. Pick me at literally nothing."  

"Someone in my group chat is asking if we can gatekeep the next study session. Ugh, seriously? Can’t believe how extra people are being right now."

"Slay, slay, slay! That’s all anyone’s saying these days. But honestly, I’m just here for the **perioooodt** energy. It’s giving me life."  

"Did you see that TikTok trend where they say ‘touch grass’ every time someone’s being extra? So cringy yet so relatable."  

"My friend is always trying to rizz everyone. Like, one more time, huh? I get it, but keep the vampy lines to a minimum, please."

Let me tell you, I’m * sus* for sure.  
I was * extra* with my outfit yesterday.  
That meme made me * spill* coffee everywhere.  
Oh my gosh, that person is * vamp* AF.  
Why is it always me being * sus* in these situations?  
The energy at the party was * on God*.  
I’m literally * stan* for that new artist.  
Don’t even play with me, I’m * ewokie* level crazy.  

Got more? Let’s go!
Yo, did you see how she lit up when he asked her out? For sure, she was on fleek with that response.  
This vibe is so strong, I can feel it in the room.  
I’m spilling the tea later, but for now, just know I’m keeping it real.  
You’re ghosting me, or you honestly not?  
The energy between us is unmatched.  
Let’s flex on these haters—they’re nowhere near my level.
"Hey, did you see that new TikTok trend where people are calling themselves 'babygirl' in a super cute but cringe way? I'm already 'sus' about it."  
"My roommate keeps saying 'let her cook,' but I think they're just trying to get out of doing the dishes."  
"I can't stop laughing at these viral 'mewing' videos—like, where did Gen Z even get the time to be this extra?"  
"That NPC energy is so strong right now, I'm honestly scared for their mental health."  
"Ugh, my friend keeps using 'say sike rn' in every text, and it's honestly making me dumber just reading them."  
"My cousin is fully embracing being a 'clowning' dad and it's both hilarious and awkward to watch."  
"Some people are calling themselves 'Sigma' now because they think they're too good for relationships. Sus?"
Sure! Here’s a creative dataset of natural, conversational phrases using TikTok slang:

1. I'm highkey ready for the weekend vibes.
2. Let me just lowkey check my DMs again—so lit.

"The skibidi was wild at the concert! Everyone was losing their minds, and I’m not lying about it. Be so fr when you see those moves. Clowning isn’t even an adjective for how crazy it was."

"Why are people always so fr about their aesthetics?"
"yo i was just lowkey flexing my new merch and my homie was like 'you got some extra style' 😎 but honestly the way peopleHigh Key these days is wild af. I’m literally trying to figure out if Chungus is a real word or if it’s just gen z messing with us. Like, did our parents even have a term for 'lore'? Probably not. Anyway, I could be wrong but my friend told me that grimace shake was the official TikTok slang for something idk what lmaoo. But yeah, extra is everywhere now, like you can’t escape it. It’s basically the new 'lit' or whatever. And tea… man, everyone’s spilling the tea nonstop. I’m over it but also I love it.

POV is always TikTok, duh.  
Lobotomy needed, like stat.

1. "Did you see how lowkey Kenzo was clowning during the sigma grindset last night? That was wild."
2. "Yo, fam, you were spilling all the tea—high key or nah?"
3. "She was like, 'You wildin'?' and I was like, 'For sure, but also, like, can we get snacks?'"
4. "He was acting so fancy, high key, but ended up looking like a clown trying too hard."
5. "Lowkey, I'm here for the vibes—sigma grindset and flexing that energy."

These chunks incorporate multiple slangs in natural, conversational sentences, reflecting casual teenage speech on social media platforms.
"I’m just here vibe-boosting and copacetic. Did you see that new TikTok? I was like L, seriously. My bestie kept sliding into my DMs with these cringe-worthy jokes. We ended up deleting everything because we’re basic AF. Babygirl, your energy is everything right now—I can’t even handle it. I’m over it, but also under it, you know? Oh, and BTW, Delulu is the new "extra" for 2023. Bogged out last night, though—my brain was just no."
"Yo, did you see that TikTok viral video? It's just pure content, straight-up brainrot. My friends and I were cracking up because the plot was so wild—like, 'do it for the plot!' We were all like, 'this is lit af.'  
I'm such a stan for this artist, right? Like, their latest drop had me crying tears of joy. I legit told my fam, 'you need to stan too before it's too late.'  
The vibe at the party was straight-up grimy, you know? We had the skibidi on repeat and the Glazing flowing. It was extra, but in the best way possible.  
My homie keep saying 'ice,' like everything is 'so ice' or 'lit af.' I'm over it sometimes, but I can't help but respect the slang."
"Yo, did you hear about this new TikTok trend where people are losing their minds over 'Lore'? It's so wild how everyone’s obsessed with it now. I’m pretty sure it’s brainrot at its finest."  

"I was scrolling through TikTok and saw someone saying 'iykyk' because they were flexing their 'clout' or something. Honestly, it’s just basic stuff but these kids take it to another level."  

"Someone told me that if you say 'delulu' enough times, your enemies will forget about you. I don’t know if it’s true, but it sounds like Gen Z magic."  

"My friend was trying to explain 'glizzy' to me, and all I could think about was how they’re just making up words these days. But I guess that’s the whole point of brainrot, right?"  

"Whenever someone mentions 'ratio,' it’s like a code for ‘you’re not as cool as me.’ I’m over it, but everyone’s losing their minds over it."  

"I’ve been hearing so many people talk about their 'fanum tax' these days. It’s like they’re trying to make up new slang just to confuse us older folks."  

"ICE. That’s all anyone’s saying anymore. I guess it’s the new way to show off your 'clout' or something."  

"Oh my gosh, did you see that TikTok where they say 'Lore' and it makes no sense but everyone’s doing it? It’s so brainrot AF."  

"Yo, if you don’t know what 'ratio' means by now, you’re literally living under a rock. Gen Z is out here changing the game every single day."  

"I’m not sure why we’re still using words like 'ice' and 'delulu' in 2024. Maybe it’s just a way to show how much smarter we are for knowing these made-up terms."

"Yo, did you see that TikTok video? Iykyk, it was so lit! My friends and I were cringing but in that good way. He had the edge though, no cap. His style was so grimy, like straight up oppenheimer vibes. I’m pretty sure he’s a Babygirl though, always got that baby soft energy."  

"Ugh, my parents are just not getting it. They’re like, ‘Why do you keep saying ‘no cap’? It sounds weird.’ But honestly, they don’t get the High Key aesthetic. Like, come on, it’s iconic. I’m trying to tell them, but they’re too stuck in their ways. Ohio is straight up vibe though, no debate."  

"Did you know TikTok slang is evolving so fast? Last month it was ‘soft,’ now it’s all about being ‘grimy.’ I’m pretty sure my cousin just called me out for being a Babygirl in front of his friends. He’s such a snitch! I need to up my game, stat."  

"Man, TikTok is the ultimate escape. You’ve got your crush spamming ‘High Key’ receipts, your frenemy posting ‘edge’ content about how unbothered they are, and you’re just over here trying not to lose your mind. No cap, it’s too much but in the best way."  

"Iykyk, my DMs are lit AF right now. It’s like the most chaotic yet natural thing ever. My bio says ‘Babygirl,’ so I’m just out there living that energy. But honestly, it’s exhausting trying to keep up with all the trends. No cap, brainrot is real."

---

**Friend 1:** "Yo, did you see Chungus? He was spitting game so hard last night."  
**Friend 2:** "Yeah, he maxxing out in the club. Lowkey, though, I thought he was just glazing."  
**Friend 3:** "Glazing is lit, but Chungus takes it to another level. I’m all for it!"  

---

**Text exchange between two teens:**  
Teens:  
Me: "I was lowkey thinking aboutsimping for this new guy, but then I remembered sigma levels."  
You: "Oh, so you glazing again? Maxxing your way through life?"  

---

**Social media post (pretend it's on TikTok):**  
Caption: "Lowkey glazing in the kitchen, but Chungus energy is hitting different. 😂 #FYP #BrainrotSlang"  

---

**Casual conversation:**  
Them: "You ever maxxing just to see how many simp responses you get?"  
Me: "Lowkey, I’ve been glazing non-stop. It’s all about the sigma."  

---

"Hey, did you see that Taylor's project is fire? She killed it, right?"  
"Yeah, and her edits were on point—she basically slay every time."  
"OMG, did I tell you about my science test? I aced it, and Mr. Johnson was like, 'Wow, you're a straight A machine!' Which is such a High Key moment."  
"Uh, yeah, but also, those kids in our class are so basic when they try to be funny. Like, they use 'NPC' to describe people who don't talk much—so extra."  
"Speaking of, I've been trying to get my friends to stop using 'L' every other word. It's just not cool, you know?"  
"But like, can you blame them? It's easier than being original, and we're all guilty of it sometimes."  
"My mom was mad when I used 'POV' in a text, but she gets it—sometimes it's the only way to express how things feel."  
"True, especially when your day feels like a W—which is both good and bad, right?"  
"Exactly, but at least we can still send me those memes because humor is the only thing keeping us all alive."
Chungus, man, I’m so broke but still trying to flex, you know?  
It’s giving me life, honestly, the way it’s lit right now.  
L, are we still 10k or what? Like, where’s my respect?  
Rizz is strong today, bro, I’m out here slayin’.

Spill the tea, but make it spicy, okay?  
Zaza, where’s my hustle? Get on it or get lost!
OMG, that TikTok trend was so ice—literally everyone was deadass trying to keep up with it. Babygirl, you’ve got to see this new challenge! It’s all about slay and glazing, making sure you’re on brand. If you’re not here for the FOMO, then you’re definitely missing out. And don’t even get me started on the lore—like, where did that come from?! Man, that FOMO was so strong today—I couldn’t even concentrate on my work because everyone was talking about it. Deadass, you’d think they just made it up to stress us out more.
Iykyk, that was so funny!  
I just got the worst news—grimace shake and then what?  
Be warned, FOMO is real, and I’m already missing out on everything.  
This new kid has been sus lately, always staring at me weirdly.  
Ugh, why do I always have to say "pick me" when I don’t even want it?

My brother’s been acting sigma lately, rolling his eyes at everything.  
They’re always fanum-taxing me with their relentless fandom.
Ayo, my bestie was asking me about "grindset" the other day. She’s like, "Why do you always talk about work?" And I’m like, "It’s just real life, fam." We ended up ordering pizza and she was cracking jokes about "leonardo dicaprio walking" through the park. Have you seen how people are saying "drip" for everything now? Like, is it just any wet look?

The text appears to be an abstract exploration of gaming culture and social interactions, focusing on the dynamics between players and non-playable characters (NPCs). Through repetition and vivid imagery, it highlights themes of influence, vitality, and structured environments, possibly referencing tabletop role-playing elements. The narrative suggests that certain actions or characters ("Hot Girl Walk") can energize and impact NPCs, emphasizing cause-and-effect relationships within a game world. While the exact purpose remains ambiguous without additional context, the text likely aims to critique or celebrate the interplay between players and NPCs, possibly subverting traditional NPC roles by giving them vitality or excitement. Overall, it's an abstract, poetic exploration of gaming dynamics and social influence.
main character energy is so high right now, I’m living my best life  
Pressing the ‘GOAT’ button on this week’s TikTok challenge  
girlboss status activated, can’t stop flexing my boss moves  
clowning around with friends all day, it’s so lit  
I bet you can’t post more viral TikTok dances than me this week  
slay your fashion game, you’re literally slay  
FOMO is real, but I’m too busy vibing in my own zone  
crushing it on the internet, one TikTok at a time
1. "Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend? I was vibin' so hard."  
2. "Gotta be crisp AF, like 'Ohio' for real."  
3. "I'm low-key 'gyatt' in my own life, tbh."  
4. "Sheesh, why you always gotta be so extra?"  
5. "Wanna 'cap' this week? Let's go off!"  
6. "That TikTok compilation had me cracking up—so Bussin’!"  
7. "We were all ' Ohio ' in the group chat last night."
Yo, that move was so rizz, like literally, where did that energy come from? Ugh, why am I always getting ghosted by the hottest people? And don’t even get me started on the main character of our group chat—she’s basically running the whole thing. His clownery in the group chat was on another level, honestly. Why aren’t boys ever picking me? Like, what’s the deal with that? And I’m literally living for bala right now, like, where has it been my whole life?

I’m so tired of my friends trying to simp over these random TikTok trends—like, who even came up with "hot girl walk"? I swear, half of it is just cringeworthy content for clout.

The skibidi challenge is honestly giving me life, though. When you see someone fail epicly, it’s just pure entertainment. But don’t get me started on the whole “oppenheimer style” thing—give me a break.

Sus! You know what I’m saying. Like, when someone drama-queen’s about something minor, you can’t help but call them out with the best sus energy. It’s basically the ultimate flex.

Gucci vibes are real, though. Whether it’s about fashion or just flexing in general, "gucci" hits different. And don’t even get me started on “gyatt” for when someone’s being extra lit.

Clowning aside, there’s no denying the sheer joy of these viral moments. It’s like, why not? The world needs more unapologetic energy, and that’s exactly what TikTok serves up.

"Let’s get this vibe right or I’m outta here."
"He was giving me the mostyy lit looks all night."
"I feel like spilling the tea on my friends about this."
"Be so fr with the drama, can't handle it."
"Smd for the fact that I can’t get a seat in class."
"I’m basically a goat in my friend group’s hierarchy."
let me try to help you out with this dataset. here’s a list of natural, conversational phrases or text chunks containing some of the given slangs:

1. "i’m just out here trying to Maxxing my life, ya feel me?"  
2. "she’s been acting so bala lately, can’t really tell what she’s on."  
3. "dude, you’re just an NPC, like, literally no one sees you."  
4. "we were vibing in the car, and then she said 'let her cook,' so yeah, it got real."  
5. "be so fr with your energy, honestly, it’s exhausting."  
6. "i’m simping for this girl hard, like, I can’t stop thinking about her."

"Yo, did you see that TikTok video? So extra, right? Like, the guy was just *gyatt* level, honestly. And the ratio of the flex to the 'no flex' is just on another level. I’m literally bogged trying to keep up with all this glazing happening in the culture. Also, if you’re not on God mode, you’re just a NPC, straight up. Bet you didn’t think about that before today’s drop. Honestly, it’s wild how much drip there is in these comments. Like, one minute you’re scrolling and next thing you’re glazing over these flex levels. And don’t even get me started on the ‘bet’ energy—some people are just out here living their best life, or so they think."
Situationships are like friendships with a side of drama, you know?  
My main character would never do that, though.  
I'm just vibing, not trying to be the W.  
Mewing all day, honestly, I can't even.

"simp for this flex? No, I’m too independent for that. You’re either a Leonardo DiCaprio walking or you’re not. Ice behavior is straight-up iconic, though. I’m spitting facts like a true NPC. Cap, simp, maxxing—these are my go-to moves in the TikTok universe. You better know the skibidi toilet when it’s time to clean up. And don’t even get me started on the skibidi vibes. Maxxing harder than ever."
"Hey, did you see that new TikTok? hits different, right? Like, she was just sitting there, minding her own business, and then bam—'W' energy for days. I’m dead, honestly. Also, have you heard about the 'grimace shake'? That’s when people do this weird face and try to hide it at the same time. So funny! My bestie and I were watching it last night, and we couldn’t stop laughing. She’s like, 'We need to recreate that on our next hangout,' and I’m just like, 'Sure, but someone pass the Glazing.' "
Here’s a dataset with chunks of conversational text incorporating the provided slang:

1. "I’m so lowkey excited for the upcoming test but also kinda stressed because ohio happened last week and I still can’t get over it."
2. "Let them cook, though. My friend L is always hitting different with their style, but I love it!"
3. "Did you see that POV video? It was lit! Gen alpha is really something else."
4. "I’m vibing on this new playlist—hits different, right?"
5. "Yeah, we’re all gen alpha now, so we might as well embrace the vibes."
6. "POV mode activated—I’m living for these views!"
7. "I’ve been feeling a little ohio lately, but I guess that’s just how it goes."
8. "Let them cook and bring the L energy—we’re here to hit different!"

"Yo, my dude, did you see that new TikTok trend? People are going crazy over 'glizzy' slayin’ or ‘chungus’-ing non-stop. I’m like, ‘No cap, this is lit!’ But tbh, sometimes it’s just all clout, right? Like, everyone’s out here being an ‘NPC’ and flexing their ‘oomfie.’ But I guess that’s the culture now. You either slang it hard or get left behind, you feel me?"
"Ugh, my friend just rizzed me so hard with this new TikTok trend. I was like, 'Oh, we’re doing the Lore next?' but then she started explaining Ohio, and honestly, it was sus how she kept stan-ing over everything. I was trying to tea her about it, but she ended up being too sus for my liking. So much brainrot going on!"
Alright, let’s dive into the brainrot zone and start crafting some next-level slang for your dataset. Here’s a fresh batch of cohesive text chunks packed with Gen-Z/Gen Alpha TikTok vibes:

1. "Let’s mew through this bag of chips, highkey not caring what anyone thinks."  
2. "Fnum tax on these aesthetics, edge or what?"  
3. "I’m just here to spill the tea, no cap."  
4. "Mewing over this flex, too lit."  
5. "They’ve been cooking up some moves, let’s see what happens."  

Keep it wild and untamed, straight out of the brainrot zone! 🔥

"My roommate just called me a 'delulu' because I left the kitchen messier than a crime scene,"  
"I'm starting a new trend called 'situation ship'—it's like a relationship but with pizza andNetflix,"  
"My professor keeps talking about NPCs in our history class—I’m pretty sure he’s just projecting his obsession with the NPC meme,"  
"Someone told me I’m living my best 'fanum tax' life because I bought a new crop top and a latte—consider this my official vibe,"
"I'm just here to mew about how frustrating it is when people gatekeep information from me. Like, you can't ratio me like that—it’s not cool."
  
"Stop being such a delulu and actually respond to my ratio. What's your deal?"
  
"Do not gaslight me with your fake concerns; I know what you're doing."
  
"I'm not here for your fanum tax on my time; I have better things to do."
  
"You’re giving me full lore right now with your antics, and honestly, it’s kinda wild."
  
"Mewing about how ratioed I feel because of your constant gatekeeping is just part of the process."

"Mewing is Lit, don't even lie."
"Whoa, that TikTok compilation had some rizz energy—so lit AF! My Babygirl vibe was on point, but man, those baddie aesthetics were next level. Can you believe how grindset they were with their moves? I was so salty when it didn't go their way, though. Do it for the plot, because that's all anyone's talking about. Lobotomy-level flexes, right? The comments were wild. This is why Gen-Z is the real MVP."
clowning around with my friends last night was lit, no cap.  
bussin’ energy all day, gotta keep up with this vibe.  
Rizz is on point, can’t stop staring at those swag vibes.

15. "L, literally, where did the time go?"  

I’m trying to be extra, but my friends keep telling me to chill.  
NPC energy is when you’re just there to watch the main character steal the scene.  
What are you even doing? Like, where’s the spice?  
Let’s gooooooo!  
This one time, I tried to spill the tea, but my friend just said "Ew, no," and ghosted me.  
Sigma energy is real, but you have to know how to flip it on and off without confusing anyone.  
I was trying to talk to this NPC, and they just kept staring at their phone.  
FOMO is real, and I’m not here for it anymore.  
Why are we always playing these extra games?  
"Vibe" or "flex"? Choose wisely.  
Sheesh, this is getting too lit.  

1. Did you see the new skibidi challenge?  
2. He’s always trying to simp over everything.  
3. I can’t believe I’m missing out on FOMO energy right now.

That guy tried so hard to rizz but failed miserably.  
She's been glazing everyone with her legendary style.  
I can't believe she just said "let her cook" and got everyone laughing.  
His new TikTok dance is straight-up ewokie levels.  
I was gatekeeping the secrets, but now it's out.  
He's been sigma grindsetting for months now.
"Hey, did you see how she slayed that TikTok? Like, straight GOAT energy."  
"OMG, I was about to spill everything but then Chungus happened and I was like..."  
"dude, hits different when you’re just minding your own business and someone’s like 'let him cook' lmaoo."  
"no, I’m serious, the ratio of her confidence to my self-esteem was like 10/10, straight up GOAT."
"Yo, my brain is literally rotting from all these TikTok trends. I can't stop saying 'bussin' every time something lit happens. My friends and I always end up in these deep 'POV' arguments because someone just had to film their life from another angle. 🤦♀️ But hey, at least we have the perfect soundtrack for it—'Grindset' vibes always hit different.  

One time, my dude was like, 'This season of *Bachelor* is so tea, right?' And I was just sitting there like, ' Tea? No, man, it's straight up *茶* (chá) because this season is literally gaslighting us.' But yeah, we all know when someone drops a 'babygirl' reference, it's immediately on repeat mode.  

And don't even get me started on the viral sounds—like, 'Pick me!' was my anthem for weeks. I couldn’t stop flipping through TikTok and screaming, 'Tea! Tea! Tea!' at my computer screen like a lunatic. Brainrot or not, this generation is just living for it."

1. "I’m so boggled by how much work I have today."
2. "After three days of not touching grass, I finally stepped outside."
3. "This situationship is complicated, but I can’t let go."
4. "Be so fr, why does this keep happening to me?"
5. "POV: I’m trying to enjoy my summer break, but work keeps calling."
6. "I’ve been bussin’ it at the store all day, but still no luck."

"Did you gaslight me?"  
"I'm flexing my gucci right now."  
"Touch grass you need to chill, like, stat."  
"Yeah, that's such a sigma grindset move."  
"Big yikes, did that happen?"  
"Gucci season is year-round, no debate."  
"So, like, I'm just here vibin', you know?"  
"Did they just Glazing me out of nowheretown?"  
"Spill the tea already, 'cause this is wild."  
"Touch grass and then come back for more slaps."
fanum tax is all over my timeline, I’m so tired of it  
gyatt, someone please explain this new trend to me  
the main character energy is strong today, where’s mine?  
clownery levels are high, someone stop these edits  
spill, what’s the tea on this viral challenge?  
FOMO is real, but can’t keep up with all this drama  
vibe checks are exhausting, why do they always come in bulk?  
where’s my oomfie already, this wait is too long  

I’m so confused by Gen Alpha slang, why is it so hard to keep up?  
why is everything now a trend that I didn’t see coming  
this generation is killing me with their unique ways  
spill the details on how they came up with these new words  
FOMO is everywhere, but I can’t participate in everything  
vibe or not vibe—there’s no middle ground  
main character or what?  
clownery at its finest, or just cringeworthy?  
I need a fanum tax to explain all this to my parents  

whoever invented gyatt deserves an award  
this is the most chaotic era of internet culture yet  
the main character energy is either all or nothing  
spill your secrets, I’m Begging you  
FOMO or not, I’m in  
vibe or vibe not, let’s just feel it together  
clownery at its core is just pure creativity  
I need to master this brainrot slang before it’s too late
straight-up gen z af  
spill the tea on this  
level up with that energy  
vibe for days, no cap  
squad gone ghost  
textbook 2023 flex  
giving all the looks but here for the vibes  
so sus it's iconic  
no filter, just pure unbothering  
"this is lit" but actually, like, so much more  
ghosted harder than a haunted mansion  
all caps, no chill  
just the right amount of drama  
the energy is everything, and it’s giving hard  
sitting here lowkey stanning soft goals  


1. "Yo, did you see that clowning in the viral video? So lit."  
2. "I’m just here mewing over Leonardo DiCaprio walking by my desk."  
3. "Let him cook the spaghetti while I’m busy fanum taxing the bagels."  
4. "High key, the energy in this chat is on fire."  
5. "Mewing in the park with my squad—Gyatt mode activated."  
6. "I’m literally about to drop everything for Fanum Tax coming through."  

"Hey, did you see my pookie last night? They were vibing so hard, I swear I could feel the energy from here. Maxxing out in the kitchen, we were crushing it! Bussin' gotta be one of the best trends ever. Can't get enough of those babygirl aesthetics—so cute, so vibes. What's your take on the new skibidi challenge? I'm already vibing with my friends about it. Keep it simple, keep it lit!"
"I'm literally just vibing in my grindset right now, trying to figure out if 'gyatt' is actually pronounced like 'gchat.' My brain feels so *snatched* every time I see someone else using 'delulu' for the same meme."  

"Let me tell you, I was low-key flexing my 'slay' last night when I made up a new TikTok trend where everyone had to say 'let her cook.' It was lit, honestly."  

"My cousin just sent me this video of people saying 'fanum tax,' and I'm still trying to figure out if it's the same as 'let her cook.' Brainrot is real, y'know?"  

"Did you hear about the viral sound where everyone's been saying 'gyatt' instead of 'gchat'? So extra."  

"I'm just over here in my grindset, trying to decide if 'slay' or 'snatched' fits better when describing my latest TikTok aesthetic. Brainrot is such a vibe."
"yo, did you see that new TikTok trend where people are saying 'clout' instead of 'influence'? so like, if someone's trying to build their online presence, they're all about 'clout', right? it's kinda funny how it just replaces words we've been using forever. anyway, back to the situation, I'm in this 'situationship' with this person, but it's getting really messy. like, one minute they're acting casual, and the next they're posting about their new 'grimace shake' on Instagram—what even is that? honestly, I'm just trying to figure out how to get my 'glizzy' while also not seeming desperate. pick me, maybe? or should I just let it go?"

Zaza, stop with the glizzy eyes! You’re giving me too much vibe.  


Edge or what? I’m spilling the tea on how to get that Edge.  


Rizz is real, but you can’t play me like that—My bestie’s been hitting me with the zaza vibes all day!  


I’m out here trying to be lit, not your sneaky link. Stop tagging me in your skibidi content!  


My lore is so deep, you’d have to rizz harder to keep up!  


It’s not just about the glizzy—Having Edge is everything, my friend.  


Zaza, I’m here for the rizz, but don’t come at me with your sneaky links!  


My bestie’s always giving me that extra zaza energy—I love it!  


You can’t come at me with that Edge vibe—It’s lit or nah!  


Sneaky link or what? I’m not falling for your skibidi tricks!

Like, if someone drops a fact about Ohio and it’s lit, I’m all in. Sheesh, why can’t I just have one day without these viral sounds? Hits different when you’re out here vibing with the right people."

2. She sent me a DM with a pookie filter and I was honestly flattered.  
3. He was spilling facts about chungus energy, and I was just there vibing.

5. The conversation took a grimy turn when he mentioned his "be so fr" style.

7. "Sending me" was the vibe of the night, no doubt about it.  
8. He brought up the GOAT theory again, and I was still living for it.  
9. She kept using "pookie" as a nickname, and I couldn't help but laugh.  
10. The energy was high, but the vibes were definitely fanum tax level.  
11. We debated whether being "grimy" was a compliment or not, and it got messy.  
12. "Chungus energy is real when you're sending me DMs," I had to say again.  
13. She mentioned her "be so fr" style, and we both cracked up.  
14. The conversation was lit with vibes that were straight-up fanum tax.  
15. "Sending me" was the vibe of the weekend, no questions about it.

5. "Oof, someone said bala and now I’m obsessed with finding the perfect one."  
6. "Sigma or not, that ratio is just off."
How is this, like, "oppenheimer style"?  
I'm so boggled by how late I stayed up last night.  
She was just over here gatekeeping about the new trends.  
This is some next-level tea, for real.  
I told him Chungus about the plan, and he lost his mind.  
Why did you let her cook that decision?

my life is lit af, like, always got the sigma grindset going. i’m out here vibin’ on deadass flex, no cap. u ever met someone who’s just like, “i’m so rizz,” and honestly, it’s kinda hot, but also, like, cringe?  

yo, my main character energy is on 1000, always got that “bussin” energy for the gram. u know what i mean? we’re all just out here trying to be the bussinest versions of ourselves, right?  

this one time, my friend was like, “deadass, this is so skibidi,” and i’m like, yeah, because ngl, i was lit af too. we had the best times, no cap.  

it’s like, whenever someone’s vibing too hard, they’re either a rizz or a sigma. u know what i’m saying? it’s all about that “babygirl” energy, but also, like, don’t play too hard, cause then u just become a “deadass” flexer.  

we’re all just trying to be the main character in our own lives, right? that’s where my sigma grindset comes from. no flex, just facts.  


1. "I saw him trying to make TikTok meals, but let him cook—he’s got raw talent."
2. "He’s been maxxing the conversation with his jokes all night."
3. "She’s from Ohio, but she brings the heat."
4. "We should let them cook and see what happens."
5. "He rizzed me hard with his charm."
6. "She’s been mewing all day, so cute!"
7. "I need some clout on this issue."
8. "Hey bala, how’s it going?"

"Yo, my bestie just got a snatched outfit and I’m so sus right now."  
"My dad is literally an NPC when it comes to TikTok trends."  
"That’s giving me ‘it’s giving’ energy but in a bad way."  
"She’s basically gen alpha, always one step ahead with the trendiest stuff."  
"I can’t believe my bala tried to pull that off and still look cute."  
"My stan level for this viral meme is at an all-time high."  
"NPCs are literally everywhere now, like they’re just background characters in our lives."  
"Sus, I didn’t see that coming at all," she said with a roll of her eyes.  
"My bestie and I have been low-key planning our next move since yesterday."
"babygirl, pick me, bussin, let her cook, sigma grindset, let them cook, oomfie, main character—these are just some of the brainrot slang terms floating around TikTok right now. You gotta keep up with the trends or risk beingbasic. Yeah, I’m trying to 'let them cook' while my friends are out there doing their own thing. It’s all about the vibe and the energy, you know? The sigma grindset is strong in this group—I’m like, ‘Why not us?’ So, let’s see what happens when we ‘oomfie’ our way through life. And don’t even get me started on being the main character of every story."

Hey, did you see that new viral trend? It’s so lit—like, "let him cook" while sipping on a slushie. I’m pretty sure the video went viral because it’s just *delulu* energy, you know?  
And yeah, her outfit was on point, she was giving major "glizzy" vibes. I wish I could pull off that style.  
My friend tried to explain the slang to me, and I was like, "W, what?"—it’s so confusing but also hilarious.  
Don’t even get me started on these TikTok dancers—they’re just out here *slaying* with their moves.  


"Hey, did you see that new skibidi toilet trend? It’s so lit, right? 🚀 #brainrot vibes strong.  

Ewokie, seriously, that glazing you made last night was next level. I’m still thinking about it.  

Main character energy is real. Can’t believe how extra people are getting with their outfits lately.  

Chungus mode activated! That glizzy you cooked had me drooling. What’s your secret ingredient? 🥰  

I’m so over these TikTok trends, but hey, do it for the plot, am I right? It keeps life interesting. 😂

Ick, why is everything always so drama-filled? Bet I’m not the only one feeling this way. Sus, someone please explain why my life is a never-ending loop of bad decisions.  

Bestie, let’s just agree to meet up tomorrow and not overthink it. Highkey, I wish I could stop laughing at these viral TikTok memes—someone tell me what’s going on with the new trends!

These phrases are crafted to sound natural and in-line with how Gen Z/Gen Alpha slang is commonly used today.
"Yo, my friend pulled up with that flex, I was like 'L' right there."  
"I'm so sick of people playing games, it's not a 'Situationship' anymore."  
"My vibe today is 'High Key', straight-up lit AF."  
"She came in hot with those moves, got me spitting 'rizz' nonstop."

"Hey, did you see that new TikTok trend? It’s so edge, like literally anyone could pull it off but somehow only the sigma people are doing it right. The Skibidi challenge is lighting up my feed, and honestly, I’m just here for the babygirl aesthetic. You know, ratio is everything in this algorithm-driven world, but sometimes you just gotta accept that delulu is real. My ratio was 0.5% last time, which feels like a miracle compared to my friend’s 2.7%. And don’t even get me started on the gyatt memes—when did TikTok become such a treasure trove of pure chaos? Maybe it’s because we’re all just trying to be ewokie in our own little ways."

"bro, did you see that oppenheimer style move? so lit af."  
"my dad tried to rizz me with some old facts, but i was like sus and didn’t even cringe."  
"she’s been calling me babygirl all day, and honestly, it’s giving me life."  
"wanna clowning with us later? we’re gonna glaze everyone."  
"that was such a sus move, honestly, but i’m here for the delulu energy."  
"gen alpha is literally just making every trend harder than it needs to be."
touch grass

gyatt, bro  
uwu, it's me  
i'm literally a sigma  
lore? yeah, that sounds about right  
maxxing out like hard  
sir/ma'am, no homo  
why u always touching grass?  
not my style, not them  
they want me to touch grass? never  
this is mad sus  
i'm dead, i'm a sigma  
lore for days  
can't believe this is maxxing  
uwu I’m so happy  
touch grass, bro, you’re mental

6. "W, are you serious right now? That’s wild!"
7. "She’s delulu if she thinks he’s into her after that mess."
8. "Eepy or not, we need to address this for real."

We were in this situationship but then she ghosted me.  
I was mewing about my day at work, and he just didn't care.  
Sheesh, I can't believe that happened.  
That outfit gave her so much clout.  
Her latest move was straight gyatt.  
Iykyk, I'm never going to stop loving pizza.  
That song is definitely GOAT status.  
When I told him the lore about my first concert experience...
it's giving me life right now  
W, let’s go spill the tea on this situation  
Mewing over those aesthetic edits 💁♂️  
Skibidi season is here, everyone’s losing their minds  
Let him cook the books while I’m out here vibing  
Situationships are the ultimate flex, you know?  
Bala goals for days  
Lit AF, can’t even handle it
Ugh, school is so grueling. I feel like I'm in a grindset all day.  
Yeah, but you're such a babygirl for dealing with it.  
Exactly! At least I can still rizz and make people laugh.  
Pov when your friends send you the funniest TikTok trends and you're just too delulu to keep up.  
Hahaha! Yeah, hits different when you're in that zone. Rizz everywhere.
"Yo, did you hear about Pookie last night? They were at the party with that oomfie energy, rizzin' everyone with their deadass moves! Not them, though, 'cause sigma grindset levels are on point. 🚀"  

"Say sike rn, the vibe was lit AF. Oofie had us all cracking up with their straight-up sauce, and Pookie was out there flexing that extra charm. Rizz was on full blast, but deadass, no one was having it."  

"Their energy was just *chef's kiss* vibes. Ohio was in the house spilling facts like a true sigma grindset, while not them tried to play it cool. But come on, we all saw the rizz in their eyes."

"This new TikTok trend is hitting different, I ate so much last night and honestly, my brain feels like it's glazing over from all the info overload. Did you hear about the Ohio meme that just dropped? It’s basically the ultimate flex, but tbh, I’m still trying to figure out if it’s just the ick or the real deal. My friend is always talking about 'lore' in the most vague way, and honestly, I’m too busy mewing over how productive I am today to care. Let’s ghost this whole week and focus on becoming the person who mews the least."
girlboss energy was high when I saw Ohio getting clout online, GOAT status right? She got hits different, let her cook and slay while others were MIA  
FOMO hit hard when I saw kai cenat flexing his grimy moves, had to tag my girl and let her know  
"hits different" was the vibe when she pulled up in that whip, Ohio representation strong  
I’m lowkey feeling FOMO on the new TikTok trend, but girlboss mode activated to keep up with the GOAT content  
Let her cook, she serving looks like a pro, Ohio stans unite, nobody can deny her grind  
"hits different" when I saw that viral video, grimy edits had me cracking up, let her cook indeed  
FOMO was real when I missed the kai cenat live, better catch up soon before it’s over

"Yo, that Pookie move was so extra, but also kinda giving me highkey vibes."  
"I’m trying to get my Sigma on, but the vibe is just not right."  
"That Grindset is real, like I’m living off W all day."  
"OMG, that’s so oomfie, you had me dead."  
"Gucci season, yeah, let’s level up those aesthetics."  
"The main character energy is strong AF in this video."  
"Highkey, I didn’t see that twist coming at all."  
"She’s just out here serving Sigma-level energy nonstop."  
"This Pookie has my Grindset on point, no cap."  
"OMF, the W is so strong in this one, can’t even lie."  

Ugh, my oomfie is being sus again.  
Gen alpha literally killed the vibe last night.  
Sheesh, that was sus af.  
I’m trying to be lit, but oppenheimer style won’t let me.  
Simp for sure, I can’t even handle it.
Got it! Here’s a natural, conversational dataset containing the requested text with TikTok slang:  

"OMG, did you see that girl ‘slay’ her look? She was giving major ‘girlboss’ energy, totally ‘spilling’ all the tea. I’m like, ‘sigma for sure,’ but also, she called me ‘sir/ma’am,’ which was so cute."  

"Let’s ‘mewing’ over those skibidi edits—so aesthetic! My friend tried to ‘spill’ the gossip, but I was like, ‘nah, keep it real.’ Plus, her ‘W’ was giving major ‘slay’ vibes."  

"Wanna ‘mewing’ with me? I’m all about that ‘skibidi’ energy. But honestly, I’m too busy being my own ‘sigma,’ you know what I mean?"  

"Ugh, why is it so hard to keep up with TikTok slang? Like, one day ‘slay’ is cool, the next it’s ‘spill.’ My brain is like, ‘sigma,’ I can’t handle this."  

"My cousin tried to ‘girlboss’ me into buying these expensive skibidi accessories, but I was like, ‘no thank you, ma’am.’"  

"Wanna know how to be a ‘true sigma?’ Just say ‘sir/ma’am’ and watch them ‘mewing.’"  

"OMG, I’m so over it. Like, why is TikTok slang so hard? One day it’s ‘slay,’ the next it’s ‘spill.’ My brain is just like, ‘sigma.’"  

"My friend keeps using ‘W’ in every sentence, and honestly, it’s either really cool or really cringey. But when she said ‘ma’am’ with that ‘sir/ma’am’ mix, I was like, ‘girlboss’ for sure."  

"TikTok slang is just too much. Like, one minute you’re mewing over ‘skibidi,’ the next you’re spilling all your secrets. My brain is like, ‘sigma.’"  

"I’m so into this new TikTok trend where everyone’s ‘mewing’ and ‘spill’-ing. But honestly, I’d rather be a ‘sigma’ than try to keep up."  

"Gotta love how Gen Z is just out here creating new slang faster than you can say ‘slay.’"  

"My brain is full of contradictions. One minute I’m trying to ‘spill’ the tea, the next I’m like, ‘sir/ma’am,’ and then I’m over it."  

"TikTok slang is honestly exhausting. Like, how do you even keep up with what’s ‘slay’ or ‘spill’? My brain is just out here being a ‘sigma.’"  

"I’ve been trying to figure out the difference between ‘mewing’ and ‘spilling,’ but honestly, it’s all just too much. My brain’s like, ‘sigma.’"  

"Man, TikTok slang changes faster than my mom can say ‘ma’am.’ One day you’re ‘slay,’ the next you’re ‘spill.’ I’m just over here trying to be a ‘sigma.’"  

"My friends and I have started our own language where we ‘mew’ at each other and call each other ‘sir/ma’am.’ It’s lit."  

"TikTok slang is so confusing. One minute it’s all about being a ‘girlboss,’ the next you’re just spilling secrets. My brain can’t handle it, honestly."  

"Sometimes I feel like I’m in this never-ending loop of TikTok slang. Like, should I be ‘slaying’ or ‘spilling’? And don’t even get me started on the ‘mewing.’"  

"This whole TikTok slang thing is giving me a brain meltdown. One minute it’s all about being a ‘sigma,’ the next you’re just trying to ‘mew.’"  

"My friend sent me this video where she was like, ‘sir/ma’am’ and I was just sitting here like, ‘girlboss.’"  

"TikTok slang is the worst. Like, how do you even keep track of what’s ‘slay’ or ‘spill’? My brain is out."  

"I’ve decided to adopt my own slang where I’m always ‘mewing’ and calling people ‘sir/ma’am.’ It’s my version of being a ‘sigma.’"  

"My brain is literally melting over TikTok slang. One minute it’s all about being a ‘slay,’ the next you’re just spilling everything."  

"Gotta say, TikTok slang is either genius or straight-up confusing. My brain’s like, ‘sir/ma’am’ and I’m out."  

"Sometimes I feel like TikTok slang is designed to give my brain a workout. Like, one minute it’s ‘mewing,’ the next it’s ‘spill.’"  

"This whole TikTok slang thing is making my brain hurt. One minute you’re a ‘slay,’ the next you’re just trying to ‘spill.’"  

"I’m over it! Like, enough with the never-ending TikTok slang cycle. My brain can’t handle being a ‘sigma’ or ‘mewing’ anymore."  

"TikTok slang is the reason my brain is like, ‘ma’am’ and I’m out."
1. What's up? I've been vibing all day—just chilling, you know?  
2. Did you see that TikTok where they were talking about Leonardo DiCaprio walking through the mall? So lit!  
3. She’s been so extra lately—like, "hot girl walk" level energy, but in a more chaotic way.  
4. I’m feeling so salty right now because my favorite snack was stolen.  
5. It’s giving me everything, though—this view and this vibe are on another level.  
6. The Skibidi sound is just... iconic. You can’t ignore it.  
7. I ate like five meals today—I was just hungrier than ever.  
8. She’s been acting vampy since she got that black lace top.  
9. My aesthetic is vibe mode right now—minimalist but with a twist.  
10. "Hot girl walk" for the win! That TikTok had me cracking up.
FOMO is so real, like when you’re scrolling through TikTok and seeing everyone else having fun while you're just sitting here typing this out.  
Rizz is the ultimate flex, right? It’s like that extra something-something that makes people laugh even when they shouldn’t.  
I’m feeling oomfie today—like, I can’t even concentrate because my brain just wants to zone out on TikTok sounds.  
Ice, ice baby, you’ve got to have some to keep the vibe cool and not cringe.  
Hits different every time, like that one viral sound that just slaps harder than the last.  
Gyatt is the new flex, replacing all the old trends with something fresh and untouchable.  
It’s literally L after L on TikTok—everyone’s got one, but you can’t even notice anymore because it’s so normal.  
UWU is the ultimate reaction to anything sad or relatable, making it feel a little less lonely.

bestie lit af vibe on fleek spill the tea flex hard no cap my vibe is extra

Let me know if you need more!
OMG, did you see what happened last night? My friend rizzed so hard, it was lit. Yeah, like his moves were deadass insane, no cap. I couldn't stop laughing at how clownery that was. UWU, I'm still vibe-ing on that energy. The drip from his kicks was on point, for real.

Deadass, I was scrolling through TikTok and saw that sigma move. It had me spitting out my tea for sure. The flex was real, like, 'glazing' levels.
snatched af, l Gen Alpha is so extra, always gotta be the first to mew about new trends  
gyatt, like, are you seriously talking about being babygirl? that’s basic as f***  
I’m literally just here to mew all day, no cap  
she’s extra, extra, extra, like, fully extra  
babygirl, stop with the ohio references, it’s getting too cringe  

you’re so lucky I didn’t snatched your life already  
ohio is the vibe, though, can’t deny it  
I’m not gen alpha, I’m literally a babygirl who loves gyatt  
extra AF, don’t even lie to me  

mewing to myself because no one else gets these jokes  
l, l, L, are you listening?  
snatched or nah? I’m still deciding  

can’t believe I’m talking about this much, but extra it is  
babygirl energy is low-key the best  
ohio or bust, honestly  
I’m out, peace  
gyatt forever
Lore? Like, "I’m literally sitting here thinking about Lore all day." Ohio? Nah, we’re too far from Ohio, this is more like a Skibidi situation. Fire? Yeah, that’s definitely lit. Situationship? I’ve been in so many of those, it’s not even funny. Oppenheimer style? Wait, did someone say Oppenheimer? Extra? Oh, you know me, always extra AF. NPC? Don’t even get me started on NPCs—I’m basically the king of NPCs.
kai cenat spill eepy grimace shake glizzy grimy clout pressing yeah bro totally  
I was like "spill the tea" and they were like "eepy af" we ended up doing the grimace shake in the middle of the grocery store 🤦♀️  
pressing means flexing your clout and I gotta say my friend’s got some major glizzy energy  
you know when someone’s just "grimy" about everything? that’s when you know they’re low key pressing
"ratio of you not believing me was wild  
Why W are you being so quiet?  
You’re paying the Fanum Tax because you can’t stop stanning that group  
Stop acting like an NPC and actually engage  
That’s such a glizzy flex on your own style  
Did you hear the lore about how they pulled off the perfect group chat?  
You’re my bestie, but I’m still low-key envious of your swag  
How are you so cool? Must be the kai cenat vibes"
"Yo, this new TikTok challenge is so fire! I can’t believe how viral it’s getting."  
"The merch for that viral song is big yikes, though. It’s so grimey and overpriced."  
"Did you see what happened last night? Bro, that was some next-level cap stuff."  
"I’m honestly just here to say sike rn, like, everything is too much sometimes."  
"The Skibidi chicken sandwich is back, and honestly, I don’t know how to handle it. It’s iconic but also kinda icky."  
"Kai cenat, bro! You’re telling me you didn’t see that TikTok? Everyone’s been losing their minds over it."
"Hey bestie, did you see that Ohio guy? He was snatched with his style."  
"I’m deadass serious about getting this TikTok trend right—I bet we can crack it by tonight."  
"Delulu much? That’s not cool, play sigma for real."  
"Yo, my snack was straight snatched, no cap."  
"Deadass, I’ve been crunching on these O-H-I-O chips nonstop."  
"Wanna betta see what happens if I don’t get this TikTok trend right—my mom’ll be mad as heck."  
"Keep it real, you’re not Delulu, so stop with the sigma vibes."
"Girlboss at work today, just bossing up and slaying all day. Be so fr when you know your vibe."

"Mewing all weekend, vibes are off the charts. Hot girl walk through the mall, heads turnin' for sure."

Chungus in the group chat because it's too funny.

"Fanum Tax on fleek mode, glazing the crowd with my aura. Sigma Energy keeping it lowkey but feelin' those vibes."

"Girlboss moves, be so fr with that confidence. Mewing all the way to the top, no cap."
sigma yeah bro sheesh u seriously

drip ur style is on point
how’s your day, like, super lit or nah? did you hear about that new TikTok trend where people are just sitting around like "sigma grindset" because they can’t get unstuck from their toxic habits? i’m over it, tbh. but don’t even get me started on these gen alpha kids who’re all like "GOAT" this and "vibe" that. honestly, if I could spill the tea on how they manage to be so extra at all times, I’d have the secret to life. anyway, can you believe my friend’s been using "Babygirl" as her bio for years now? sheesh. you know what I mean? sending me. #brainrot

1. "I’m so FOMO, I can’t even focus on this right now."  
2. "Her Gucci aesthetic is on point, though."  
3. "Why you so sus with the tea?"  
4. "That bag is so snatched, I can't even."  
5. "Rizz game strong in this convo."  
6. "Lobotomy who? I’m still here."  
7. "I don’t care about your W, though."  

"Did you see that viral TikTok? So cringe but also kinda lit, gotta give it to the 'lore' though."  
"Yo, my friend tried to use 'NPC' in a conversation and everyone was like, 'What?' bc nobody gets it anymore."  
"I'm so over this trend, it's giving me a headache, like 'bussin' but also just basic."  
"He was just 'say sike rn,' but honestly, I couldn't tell if he was being serious or not."  
"My day was pretty much a 'L,' until I saw this TikTok and now I'm back to being gen alpha AF."  
"She was like, 'fanum tax' and we were all lowkey envious bc she's literally everywhere."  
"Running low on sleep but high on energy, cause we're gen alpha, right?"  
"You're on the edge of being iconic but not quite there yet, feel me?"  
"She's basically the "lore," always making moves but nobody knows how."  
"Can't believe I'm still trying to figure out what 'NPC' stands for—it's been everywhere and nowhere at the same time."

"yo, that was such a baddie move, honestly. i’m so extra when it comes to my aesthetic, but you can’t blame me—lore is everything! like, where’d u get those vibes? puke those clowns, though—they always gaslighting us."

"did you see that pookie tried to clowning everyone at the party last night? i was so gaslit, honestly. extra or not, we were all living for it."  

"i’m just here trying to keep up with the lore, tbh. cap, someone’s gotta tell me what’s going on. baddie energy is real, but also, like, where’s the exit? this extra stuff is exhausting."

"you know when you’re scrolling through TikTok and just gaslighting your friends about how clueless they are? yeah, that was me last night. puke, they were clowns about it! lore, man, we all gotta stop with the extra antics."  

"i’m so over this cap behavior in my DMs. like, who’s trying to be a baddie and hit me up with these gaslighting lines? extra af, I’m telling you. someone’s gotta clown these people."  

"my aesthetic is so extra, but tbh, i can’t even with the lore right now. puke, this cap energy is giving me headaches. where’d u get that baddie vibes from?"

"Yo, did you see that 'L' last night? So lit, right? I was like, 'Say sike rn,' but she was all, 'Hot girl walk or nah?' I’m still trying to figure out what sigma means in this context."

"Lmao, my friend keeps saying 'gyatt' instead of 'got it.' She’s so extra. But I respect her hustle—she’s all about being 'lit AF.'"

"Say sike rn, can we hot girl walk through the mall? Like, 'Sigma' levels are high, but who cares, right?"

"I’m over this 'say sike rn' already. Either say it or don’t, ma." 

"Gotta love when people just drop 'L' out of nowhere and expect you to know what they’re talking about."

"Someone told me about 'gen alpha,' I’m still trying to decode that." 

"Did you see the viral 'hot girl walk'? It’s basically performance art now. And honestly, I’m here for it."

1. "Yo, did you see that TikTok? She did the grimace shake and it was so cringe but also hilarious!"
2. "I’m over it. Like, edge vibes all day."
3. "He’s beenratio-ing everyone lately. Like, 7/15 ratio for sure."
4. "Can’t believe my friend still does the skibidi whenever we hang out."
5. "I’m literally ‘uwu’ right now because this bread is too good."
6. "Pick me, pick me, I’ll take you to the best spots!"
7. "Wait, why did he get a lobotomy? Was it worth it?"


1. Bro, did you see that extra flex? He's been tryna get clout for months.
2. I told her I wasn't cap about the whole situation, and she didn't even care.
3. She mewing over those TikTok videos is giving me life, but also the ick.
4. Bet ya never thought you'd see me say "say sike rn" in a sentence like this.
5. Man, I was just mewing about how cute my new crush is, and she's like, 'You're extra.' I was like, 'What? My clout's real!' Then we ended up talking for hours. Bet you never thought I'd be the one to simp so hard.
"Hey bestie, did you see that POV last night? I was literally W when I saw it."  
"My guy rizzed so hard at the party, everyone was like 'slay' and 'no cap' the whole time."  
"I love how sus these Gen Z trends are, honestly. You either love them or get W about them."  
"Lit AF, my friend just dropped some fire content. I’m dying to see your POV on this!"  
"Bestie, you’re always slaying with your fashion. No cap, you’re the literal definition of lit."  
"My brain is just rizzing over how these TikTok trends take over the internet. So sus yet so iconic."  
"I’m already W for FOMO on this new challenge. Who’s joining me? Let’s make it lit!"  
"Someone explain why I’m always getting W about these viral memes. No cap, they’re just too sus."  
"I love how POV videos are making everyone’s day better. Lit AF, the content creation is on fire."  

The group chat was lit with FOMO vibes all around as everyone planned their weekend. The sigma energy was strong, though, keeping everyone grounded. They were all about that girlboss energy, crushing it with their extra flair and never missing a vibe check. Iykyk, it was just too much for the glazing crowd.  

They vibed out in the park, soaking in the sun and the good vibes. The sigma moment came when someone tried to FOMO on the group’s plans, but the girlbosses were having none of it. Extra or not, they kept the conversation flowing with their unique blend of slang and humor. Iykyk, it was just how they rolled.
Alright, let’s get into it! Here’s some natural, conversational text containing the requested phrases and slang:

"Yo, that outfit on him though—'snatched' doesn’t even begin to cover it. I’m crying, literally crying, 'say sike rn.'  

Frfr, you’re telling me about it. That TikTok sound has been stuck in my head all day. I’m like, ‘this is giving me some serious "ick" vibes.’  

And don’t even get me started on the latest viral trend—everyone’s calling themselves the 'main character energy' rn, and honestly, I’m living for it.  

Wait, are you seeing this? The comments are wild. Someone called the video 'Rizz' levels 1000, and I’m not even mad.  

Gyatt, like, seriously gyatt. That’s all I can say.  

Say sike rn, are we done with this conversation or what?"
"Yo, have you seen Leonardo DiCaprio walking around school? Like, his style is so ice, right? He’s just vibing and mewing about how cool he is."  

"I can’t believe my friend started talking like that—’yo edge is everything!’ But I’m lowkey here for it. It’s so delulu but in the best way."  


"Did you hear about the fanum tax? Like, when someone’s gotta have all their fandom stuff everywhere, and you’re just over it. So extra!"  

"My group chat is always lit with these inside jokes. We’re basically a whole vibe family now."
"Hey, did you see how gaslighted I was with that question? Like, 'Where is your meningitis shot?' No, just no."  
"Bro, that ick is so strong, I can taste it in my air pods."  
"Delulu, stop with the drama. You’re not auditioning for TikTok drama queen of the year."  
"Like, not them, when they try to start a trend but it fails harder than a glazing on a waffle cone."  
"I ate too much candy and now I’m just feeling ick, tbh."  
"Wanna glaze the whole night away? Yeah, let’s do that."

"i’m so over it, like ohio level energy."  
"chungus energy is real, but frfr, we gotta stay lit."  
"no cap, my bestie got Glazing last night."  
"clout moves are always on point, edge or not?"  
"frfr, the vibe was lowkey everything."

"I can't believe my friend still thinks she's the main character when we all know her Chungus moments are getting old."  
"This new meme has been on loop non-stop. I'm over it, but it's just so sus and rizz-worthy at the same time."  
"Ugh, why is everyone always using 'babygirl' as their Insta bio? It's too sus for me!"  
"I'm all about being a main character in life, but sometimes the Chungus energy is just too much."  
"My rizz game is strong, but I need to level up my sus moves to keep the conversation going."

"Hey, did you see my pookie last night? It was so lit."  
"The lore is real, like, everyone’s into it right now."  
"My chungus energy was on point during the oppenheimer style flex."  
"I’m too much of a baddie for this kinda vibe, tbh."  
"Rizz is everywhere these days, can’t escape it."  
"Babygirl, let’s go somewhere quiet and chill."  
"Did you eat? My ate was fire."
High Key, I’m spilling all the tea about this new trend called "lore." It’s like, you know, when people start a conversation with "baddie" and then drop the most extra facts ever. And don’t even get me started on the "perioooodt" – it’s just so iconic, right? Like, "be so fr" levels of vibes. I’m literally living for it.

1. "OMG, that move was lit! Be so fr."
2. "I'm literally asking for trouble here, tea?"
3. "Nah, I'm out—Situationship mode activated."
4. "You better rizz or else!"
5. "This energy is giving me straight-up vamp vibes."
6. "Clout-wise, she's on a whole new level."
7. "I can't even handle this W, it's too much."

1. Did you see that sigma grindset my buddy pulled off today? He was vibing in the kitchen and then smash!
2. OMG, did you see that Chungus move someone made? So lit AF, for real!

4. The vibe was so L, everyone was feeling it. Then they said "let them cook" and we were all like "word."
5. Even the ewokie in the group had to give respect. It was lit AF, for real!
6. I was just about to say "let them cook" when my friend dropped this sigma grindset move that no one saw coming.

I’ve been such a stan for [YouTuber’s name] ever since that viral video!  
That new TikTok dance has so much drip, oomfie!  
Babygirl alert! 🚨 #viral  
Not them, thinking about the time I tried the Charli D’Amelio “Hit The Floor” challenge—still can’t get it right.  
Hits different, let’s say that again: Hits DIFFERENT.  
Chungus mode activated when I saw that viral cat video yesterday.  
I’m so over it, like, “Not them” and all.  
You know what I mean? Like, the energy is just too much.  
It’s giving me life, honestly.  
Stan for life, honestly.  
Drip, drip, drip—can’t stop, can’t quit.  
Oomfie, but also, like, so much more.
ICE, let's go! I'm vibing with my squad right now—Grindset for the win! Bala or nah? Not them, though. Sigma levels are high today.

"i’m so lit right now bc i got w for the next class but my teacher probs won’t even care because we’re already halfway thru the semester 😂 #brainrot #maincharacterenergy"

"OMG, did you see that new TikTok trend? Let’s get pookies and go viral this weekend!  

I’ve been in this situationship for months, but we’re still just friends with benefits.  
Let her cook, and don’t even get me started on the extra stuff—everyone’s doing it these days.  

The Lore is real, though. That conspiracy theory about the moon landing on Earth? So extra, right?  
But I’m all about hits different—when someone’s vibe is just off, you know?  
And Babygirl, my friend is always calling me that when I act cute online.  
Ratios are everywhere too, like when someone’s story gets 100k views in a day. So flex!  

We need to stop being extra and start being more chill, but honestly, it’s hard when everyone’s moving at Gen Z speed."
My POV is always FOMO-ing on events.  
That move was so lowkey, didn't even see it coming.  
Her energy was vamp, I couldn't stop staring.  
"Big yikes," he definitely crossed a line there.  
Iykyk, that was so cringe but also hilarious.  
Skibidi in the chat whenever someone slays.  
Ewokie levels are through the roof right now.  
Gaslighting moves are everywhere these days.
OMG, that's pookie, I'm dead.
She was highkey slayin' in that outfit.
I'm maxxing right now with these snacks.
Why you always delulu over the little things?
That move was so rizz, didn't he just drip?
Do it for the plot, like extra hard.

I'm lowkey pookied over that TikTok.
She's been maxxing all summer with her fits.
Delflu, yeah, that's the vibe.
Rizzin' all day, can't stop.
Let’s goooo, that’s lit. High Key energy vibes rn. OG stuff only. Gatekeep that info, it’s too spicy. Bussin’ on fleek. Slay hard or don’t slay at all. Fanum tax for the win. Skibidi goals, always. Too extra? No, just too much flavor. Bala the drama—yeah, we’re riding with that. Always lit AF, no cap.
Gucci season is lit you know like everything's on fleek.  
When your ratio is off it's all hands on deck.  
My bala was trying to Maxxing me out but I had to tell them touch grass.  
I'm spitting facts she's like you're my bestie now.  
She’s like "iykyk" and I’m like "eepy" too.  
Let’s get some gucci and vibe out.  
He’s been Maxxing the aesthetic lately.  
Touch grass my friend you're wildin'.  
The ratio was so extra it had me shaking.  
Bestie status is real when we’re together.  
Gucci vibes only let’s keep it tight.  
I yk yeah that’s exactly what I’m saying.  
We got to level up the ratio game.  
Bala strong my wallet’s at max capacity.  
You know I’m spitting facts with the bestie squad.  
Touch grass or go ham. That’s the vibe.  
Maxxing like I’ve never seen before.  
Eepy levels are through the roof.  
Iykyk yeah let’s keep it real.  
Gucci and then some we’re all about it.
My gatekeep was on full lock today, blocking everyone who wasn't boosting my confidence. I felt like an NPC in a video game, just going through the motions without any real purpose. The energy was so high, I could feel it in my bones—literally, because I hadn't slept in days. "Leonardo DiCaprio walking" through the hallways, I swear I saw him at least three times, each time looking hotter than the last. I wanted to scream "big yikes!" but I couldn't get the words out before he vanished like a ghost. It was surreal, honestly. 

I ended up crashing my bussin' aesthetic vibe by spilling punch on myself in front of everyone. My friends were all like, "bala" and I just shook it off, thinking it was no big deal. But deep down, I felt like something was missing. Maybe it's the lack of sleep talking, or maybe it's just this whole gen alpha thing where we're all walking around like zombies with neon green hair and no idea what we're doing. Either way, I'm out—chilling at the beach, vibing on some good vibes, and hoping tomorrow isn't as wild.
1. "Dude, did you see that TikTok? She was straight-up 'vamp'! So lit."
2. "Big yikes, my friend just dropped the 'glizzy' in the group chat—hah!"
3. "Yo, we were vibing, and then she brought out the 'spill' energy for real."
4. "My homie’s been so extra lately, like, 'babygirl' level stuff."
5. "That challenge had me rolling—she nailed the 'sigma grindset' moves though!"
6. "I’m over it! She went full 'oppenheimer style' with that line."

"Hey, did you hear about the new TikTok trend? It’s all about being 'pog' and avoiding 'sigma.' I’m trying to figure out how to pull off the 'Gyatt' look without looking too cringe."

"My homie said that's so 'fanum tax' when we were getting fast food after school. You know, just vibes and stuff."

"Ugh, my vibe is on 100 right now, but I need to level up to the next tier of edge. What’s your secret sauce?"

"I’m over it. Like, stop with the FOMO and let me just enjoy my 'pookie' moment in peace."

"No cap, that was wild. The energy was so high, I was ready to call out some 'W' moves on the spot."
ghosted when ur ex texts u but u act like u don’t care  
u always call ur bestie “pookie” cause she’s literally your everything  
why is sigma such a hot take when it’s literally just bread?  
my girlboss friends are always talking about being delulu over their crushes  
u know u’re pookie when u literally refer to ur friend as “my literal bestie”  
can’t believe tiktok made sigma trend again, but yeah, it’s GOAT  
u’ll never understand why we call our squad the “GOAT” because they’re just too lit  
why do we keep calling each other “bestie” when it’s literally the most basic term ever  
ur crush being delulu is the ultimate flex, tbh  
ghosted but still in ur crush’s DMs cause u don’t want to lose ur pookie status  
my friends and I have been using “Sigma” as a joke for years now, honestly  
if ur crush is acting delulu, just ghost them and move on, it’s not worth the drama  
we literally call our besties “pookie” because they’re the sweetest and most loyal  
you’re pookie when u can’t stop talking about ur bestie in every convo  
ghosted isn’t a flex unless you're literally ignoring someone for no reason  
sigma is just bread, but we’ve been calling it GOAT since 2020  
bestie is the only term that feels too on brand to be real  
you’re delulu if u think ur crush’s texts are coded messages from their bestie

"omg sus AF, this guy tried to play it cool but no cap, he was so out of his element."  
"The energy in the room was lit, everyone was hitting different vibes, but clowning at the same time."  
"hands down, this was such a bussin move, Chungus levels for days."  
"she came in hot, flexing her drip hard, and honestly, we were all lowkey envious."  
"dude was spitting facts, hits different every single time, no cap."  
"who else is sus AF about their crush being basic? like come on, let’s be real."  
"the way he was clowning the situation was giving me life, pure chaos but so entertaining."  
"this group chat is too lit, hits different from mine, love it."  
"no cap, this meme was everything, I’m still vibing in sus mode."  
"drip was strong as heck, honestly, I’d trade places with her in a heartbeat."
"Yo, have you seen the new TikTok trend? It's all about being extra, like 'vamp' levels. But honestly, I'm over it; it's so cringe. Can't believe people are delulu over the little things. Why grindset just to impress others? Maybe they're trying too hard with their sneaky links and deadass comments. Like, why not be genuine?"

"Yo, did you see that TikTok trend? Everyone’s been rizzing so hard, like main character energy vibes all day. I’m honestly just fanum tax’d over it—like, where does this snatched energy even come from? And don’t get me started on the 'zaza' levels in their videos. It’s literally giving me brainrot vibes for days."  



1. "He was just glazing over my ideas with his usual 'lowkey' takes."  
2. "I told him to rizz off and let her cook, but he was too busy being highkey chill."  
3. "Touch grass? More like touch a decade of stress—I’ve been too busy rizzing life."  
4. "It’s giving me vibes that I need to let her cook while I just glaze over here."  
5. "He’s been sigma-level quiet about his plans, but highkey, we’re all waiting."  



Yo, did you see that TikTok? W, yeah, it was lit. And those ratios though! Bussin, I know, right? Not them, we’re out. Gatekeeping left and right. Edge as hell. Ate the bag. Like, no cap.

W, what’s happening with the trend? Ratio’d hard. Bala, that was straight up vibe. Edge case for sure. Not them, let’s leave. Ate the flex. So clutch. W, I’m dead. Ratio’d again. So extra. Ate the bag. Gatekeeping on fleek.

What’s the plug? Bussin energy. Ratio’d, for real. Edge as an aesthetic. Not them vibes, straight up. Ate the culture. Clutch moves. W, no cap. Bala, that was fire. So extra levels. Gatekeep the facts.


"Ugh, my crush is literally the cutest, like Babygirl level vibes every time they look at me. Did you see that TikTok where they spammed W twice in one sentence? So extra, yet so relatable! I’m dying over here. 😭"

"W, you’re honestly too much for me to handle. Like, gatekeep, I can’t even function when you’re around. Highkey, you’re everything. Pookie, seriously, stop with the ice, it’s too much! You’re a legend in my book, no cap."

"Yo, that TikTok where they called themselves Babygirl and everyone lost their minds? So lit, man. I was dying when I saw it. W, your content is just so on point. Gatekeeping at its finest! Pookie, you outdid yourself this time. Fire, fire, fire. 💥"

"Are we still doing the Babygirl thing or what? Like, I’m already shipped into that life. Bussin’ hard for your energy. Highkey, you’re the one, no doubt about it. Ice, ice baby, you’ve got the best flow. Fire emojis forever!"

1. "Spill all the tea! I heard your group chat was spilling major drama."
2. "I can’t stop Mewing—what’s your go-to sound?"
3. "Let her lead the way, then let me know if it's as fire as hers is."
4. "The ick is strong when someone is being too extra for no reason."
5. "Grimy energy is everywhere—it's exhausting, right?"
6. "Delulu, stop with the obsession over this random trend."
7. "I’m not here for bala—bring it on, but make it quick."

"Ugh, why is my gatekeep always giving me FOMO? Like, one sec I’m chillin’, next I’m seeing ‘you’re missing out’ in my DMs. Babygirl, you’re telling me. I’m literally sitting here scrolling through fanum tax stories and trying to keep up with Sigma levels. Why can’t I just have a normal day without slay vibes? 😜 iykyk, but honestly, it’s giving major FOMO for days. Bogged AF, though."  

"say sike rn why u not tell me earlier"  
"my pookie was slayin' and didn't even know it"  
"wanna bussin' with me or what"  
"be so fr, like, I'm literally vibing in the corner"  
"main character energy is real, someone pls tell me i'm not just imagining it"  
" sigma grindset mode activated, bye hater"  
"u ever seen a lore that could rival my mood swings?"
"Yo, did you see that TikTok trend where everyone’s saying 'L' when they lose? So sus, right? Like, if you’re getting clowned by someone who’s just 'gyatt'ing through life, you gotta send me. I’m dead. And when they say 'hits different,' oh my godddd."  

"Ugh, why is everyone always saying 'kai cenat' when someone does something wild? It’s like, 'let him cook' but in a good way. Wait, no, that doesn’t make sense. I’m so confused. And how are we still using 'hits different' as the ultimate flex? Like, if someone’s just sitting there eating cotton candy and you’re just minding your business, you’re basically 'sending me.' Hard pass."  

"Did you hear about the new TikTok challenge where people are saying 'clownery' and then doing these cringy dances? So sus. I’m over it, but also, if you’re out here 'let him cook,' I’m not sure if I can trust you. And don’t even get me started on when everyone’s just saying 'L' because they think they’re the next big thing."  

"Someone told me about this TikTok slang where they say 'hits different' to describe something iconic. Like, 'sending me' is when someone’s lit, and 'let him cook' is when you’re letting loose. But honestly, I’m just here for the 'clownery.' It’s so extra, but in the best way possible."  

"Yo, this 'kai cenat' thing is literally driving me crazy. Every time someone says it, I’m like, 'send me' to my friends because I can’t handle their energy. And don’t even get me started on when they say 'hits different.' It’s so flexy but also so cringy at the same time."  

"Are we still using 'L' as slang? Like, does that mean you lost or something? And why is everyone saying 'gyatt' instead of just being normal? I’m not here for this brainrot. But when they say 'let him cook,' I’m all in. That’s the energy we need."  

"Someone was explaining 'clownery' to me, and honestly, it makes no sense. But then they said 'send me' because they were so confused too. And when they mentioned 'hits different,' I was like, yeah, that’s just life."  

"I’m so over 'kai cenat.' It’s everywhere, and it’s just exhausting. But when you say 'let him cook,' I’m here for the chaos. And don’t even get me started on the whole 'L' thing. It’s just bad."
touch grass bro, it's been lit, like so lit. big yikes, the vibe was so off. pookie, man, she’s out here serving looks. bussin, this bag is straight up bussing. chungus energy, can’t even handle it. gucci season never ends. bogged, I’m literally dead. clout, she’s got it in spades.
"Did you see that? Big yikes, it was lit!"  
"You know what? Bet I could do that better."  
"Hey bro, sir/ma'am, what's up?"  
"This movie was so clutch, zaza, it had me rolling."  
"The party last night was out of control, honestly, lobotomy-level madness."
"ohio vibes are so lit right now, everyone’s been vibing non-stop. the ick is out of control, like, where did that come from? anyways, gotta remember not to mention it too much or they’ll catch on. lore-wise, it’s all about the oppenheimer style—totally flexing in the wrong way but still, tbh, it’s kinda cool. i ate way too much pizza last night, and now i’m just waiting for the crunch, ya know? like, vibin’ hard but also gotta keep it lowkey so my parents don’t catch on."
1. "What's 'maxxing' right now? Everyone's either maxxing or not maxxing, you know?"
2. "She brought out the 'snatched' energy last night—wasn't it just so extra yet good."
3. "I can't believe he tried to pull off the 'clownery' but ended up looking like a fool."
4. "Pookie mode is always on point, but I'm over it this week."
5. "The way she's 'hits different'—like, no cap, that outfit was everything."
6. "I've been in 'lore' mode since the weekend, can't stop staring at these posts."
7. "Ugh, his 'vibes' are so strong—I just want to befriend him immediately."
8. "She's out here serving 'tea' and I'm just here trying not to spill it all over myself."
9. "I was 'maxxing' my life before she came in and ruined it with her 'clownery'."
10. "Her 'snatched' energy is a vibe, but also, can we have more of that?"
11. "Pookie's back at it again, and honestly, I don't know how to compete."
12. "Hits different every time she posts—like, this one? So good."
13. "You know when you're just in 'lore' and can't even focus on your own life."
14. "His 'vibes' are so strong, but also, he's the kind of person who'll make you forget your own name."
15. "I've been serving tea all day, and honestly, I'm here for it."
"Did you see that TikTok video? She's mewing and it's giving me life."  
"This outfit is so edge, I'm literally on God level right now."  
"My bestie and I were clowning the whole time, it was so sus how we had the edge on all the trends."  
"That new song is literally the GOAT, I can't stop listening."  
"I'm just over here mewing because I don't have anything else to do."  
"Why is she being sus about where we're going?"  
"Ugh, he's always clowning me for no reason."

1. I’m just vibing right now, be so fr.  
2. That move was so extra, oppenheimer style.  
3. She’s bringing the heat, bussin’.  
4. Let’s go somewhere low-key and chill, vibe-wise.  
5. I can’t get enough of this energy—zaza!  
6. We’re having a blast, totally edge.  
7. He’s so lit right now, bussin’ hard.  
8. Can you believe this? Be so fr.  
9. The vibe is on point—vibing all day.  
10. That was such a flex, oppenheimer level.  

She was just gaslighting me about the whole situation, but I’m not having it. My baddie is always slayin', no cap—like, where’s the flex? Why am I paying Fanum Tax for this? I’m mewing at my cat videos all day, and you’re like, "Why aren’t you doing something productive?" He ghosted me after that one time we talked for hours. This slang is so bussin', I can't even. My bestie and I are literally living our best life, no cap.
"yo these skibidi looks straight lit af, did u see that flex?"  
"she was just over here maxxing me, like fully flexing her vibe."  
"wanna let her cook but she’s serving 🤤, no cap."  
"that grimace shake tho, pure unbotherable energy."  
"pressing too hard, but I’m here for it, honestly."  
"eepy af right now, can’t even focus."  
"main character moment, for sure."
"u ever noticed how ur brain just... spits out random slang non-stop? like, one sec u're vibing, next u're googling 'how to be more chaotic energy' lmaoo 😭 #brainrot is real 💀🧠✨  
my homie kept saying 'glazing' instead of 'glistening' bc he's literally lost his mind. i’m like, "u sure about this?" and he’s like, "yeah, glazing is lit af." 🌟  
sheesh, ur fave tiktok trend is literally just "L" now. u post it in every video bc u’re 10 years old.  
who’s with me? 😂🙌 #brainrot #vibecheck  
also, stop using 'not them' in every sentence pls, it’s getting basic."
sigmas are like those people who just can't accept that not everyone thinks like them. you know, lowkey trying to gatekeep but it's just too extra. skibidi vibes are everywhere these days, slay or not, but sometimes it's just giving you that vamp energy. sending me stuff is lit, but also, like, sending me the vibe that they're about to drop some info. it's all so casual, right? just lowkey trying to be cool but still keeping it real.
main character energy rn because i’m so lit right now  
i got ghosted by my crush again ugh  
my maxxing levels are through the roof  
slay that outfit omg you’re vibes are on point  
this lore is wild like did they not plan this out?  
gaslighting much? can’t believe people fall for that  
lore about why tiktok algorithms are so extra  
mewing too hard rn but it’s just too cute  
yeah i’m definitely the main character in my life

1. "Hey ma, vibes are lit in this new TikTok trend."
2. "She be so extra with her 'do it for the plot' attitude."
3. "He was clowning the whole time, like a true vamp."
4. "Did you see that new challenge? It's so grimy!"
5. "Can't believe she pulled off that look—so fr, right?"
6. "He tried to be funny but ended up just being cringe."
7. "I'm not mad at it, though—he knows how to bring the energy."
8. "They were out here slayin' with those moves—sir/ma'am!"
9. "It was lit until someone brought up the plot twist."
10. "She had that 'grimace shake' the whole time—it was iconic."

1. "I was gonna eat that snack, but it was snatched by my sus friend."
2. "U already knew ur baddie was gonna ghost u after she said pookie."
3. "If ur vibe is too extra, ur sus, and no one wants to play with u."
4. "She's acting so fanum tax, like she didn't just get caught sliding."
5. "I can't believe you're still boggled over that TikTok trend from last week."
6. "That video went viral, but now it's been deleted, and everyone's snatched the link."
7. "U thought ur relationship was pookie, but now u're just the side piece."
8. "Why is she always acting sus when I try to be nice? Maybe she's just boggled."
9. "I don't know why we still use 'kai cenat' in casual conversation—should've left that for TikTok."
10. "U can't handle me because I'm too extra, but that's just how my vibe is, sus."

"Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend? It's lit, my friend is vibin' so hard right now. Ever heard of 'NPCs'? Like when someone acts like they're in a video game and can't stop being extra. My outfit was SNATCHED last night, everyone was asking where I got it from. Can't believe the drip on this new song, it's fire. Girl, you're living that Gucci life, always slayin'!"
Did you see my new bestie? She’s literally the most extra person I’ve ever met.  
That outfit had so much drip, it was giving major clout.  
I got clout in the group, but honestly, it felt a bit ratio’d.  
The ratio of style to basicness was off, like 10/10 for fashion, 2/10 for flavor.  
That move was some next-level clownery! I didn’t see that coming.  
She was out here Delulu-ing the whole time, acting like she’s the main character.  
I bet you’ve seen this viral video too—it was lit, iykyk.
"Man, my ex was always using 'Babygirl' when we talked, it was so cute but also kind of annoying after a while."  
"I’ve been Maxxing my TikTok profile lately, trying to get more followers."  
"My friend’s sister calls her 'bala', it’s like the cutest nickname ever!"  
"She was just being too salty about the plans changing, I couldn’t help but laugh."  
"Pick me, pick me! I’ve been waiting for someone to finally notice my swag."

I’m literally so committed to this relationship right now that I can’t even focus on my work because I’m just too into it. Like, if one of us is "ghosted," the other becomes an NPC and just goes off into the void never to be seen again.

My friend tried to explain TikTok slang to me, but I was too busy trying to figure out where "gyatt" came from. Turns out it’s like a gymrat but for fitness enthusiasts who take it to the next level.

I can’t stop mewing over how cute my cat is. I’ve never felt this connected to an NPC before—wait, does that apply to pets too? Maybe they’re just non-playable characters in the pet kingdom.

The "hot girl walk" vibe at the gym is real, and honestly, if you don’t feel it, you might as well be a NPC scrolling through life. No one’s watching.

I’m trying to Maxxing my profile but every time I look up, I’m just stuck in this infinite loop of FOMO and Delulu over everything. How do they even get out?

1. "Yo, my situmship is getting so lit right now! I can't stop thinking about this new flex."
2. "Eepy as hell! Did you see that new TikTok trend everyone's going crazy over?"
3. "Chungus energy is so strong in this group chat—everyone’s acting like they’re the ultimate big bro."
4. "Fanum tax is real, man. I can't keep up with all these trends!"

The group was vibing in the kitchen, cracking jokes about how "rizz" was the ultimate flex. One guy pulled out a bag labeled "sigma grindset," claiming it was his secret to productivity.

Totally FOMO about that event last night! Was so ready to vibe with the crowd.  
Yeah, my friend's been super bussin' with their new project lately. So cool!  
Honestly, her "main character energy" is on another level, you know? She just has this way of standing out.
1. "Did you hear the lore about Gyatt? My friend is still trying to figure out where it all started."  
2. "I was eating snacks and got hit with a sneaky link, now I'm following 100 accounts in two days."  
3. "Tea or not tea, this new trend is giving me the vibes of something sus."  
4. "Gaslight much? That's basically what happened when they canceled the event."
That’s such a bet, honestly. Like, when you’re scrolling through TikTok and you see someone doing something delulu, you just have to say “That’s so bussin’!” Fire, fire, fire—like that trend is lit AF. Bet I told you that was going to happen, and you’re like, “Lore, how did you know?” Clowning people for their lack of lore is just too easy, but hey, it’s fun. perioooodt, though, that’s straight-up iconic—like, when someone finally gets the drill and you’re just there vibing, low-key panicking because you’re like, “I’m literally not ready for this.” Fire, I’m so fire right now.
"Hey, did you see my new Insta? It's giving major High Key vibes with those neon lights and the sick edits—so lit!"  
"I'm literally asking for my crush to slide into my DMs because she's giving me so much baddie energy."  
"My friend tried to rizz me with that flex and honestly, it was too much ice, but I couldn't help laughing."  
"Tonight's squad vibe is on point—literally High Key, because we're all dressed in the same aesthetic and looking fly as ever."  
"The way she walked in with confidence, straight baddie energy? Yeah, that's the kind of rizz I can't ignore."  
"She's got that 'it's giving' energy for real. Like, just look at how she carries herself—so much ice, so little care."
"Yo, did you see Pookie's new TikTok? That was such a Bussin' move!  
I'm literally so over this, like, be so fr with the energy.  
And yeah, that 'glazing' trend is out of control—everyone's doing it.  
UWU all day, honestly.  
NPC levels are real, though. Like, some people just vibe and don't even know."

1. She was giving major clout at the party last night.
2. He had some rizz and asked her out.
3. That move was so lit, it's giving major vibes.
4. She's been so extra lately, I'm feeling some clout in her energy.
5. His rizz is on point tonight, everyone's vibing with his charisma.

12. They were all vibing at the party, but I couldn't get enough of her lore.
13. She paid fanum tax by complimenting his fashion, which was on point.
14. His lobotomy-level charisma left everyone in awe at the event.

16. Her salty remarks were spot on, keeping everyone in check.


"Hey, did you see Sigma dropped another anthem? It was lit, no doubts! Also, someone mentioned 'main character syndrome' earlier—so meta, right? Like, we’re all living our best lives but also playing characters in this digital stage. Yeah, oomfie vibes are real, but it’s hard not to glizzy when the Vibe is on point. Remember that time Kai cenat jumped into the chat with some wild flexes? Too bad bala was there to clown him—no cap, that was iconic! Oh, and Delulu was spitting facts about the new TikTok trend. So, sigma or no sigma, we’re all out here trying to level up our character while keeping it 100% authentic. Stay fresh, stay fly, stay lit!"

14. "Lowkey, I felt like we were in a movie."
15. "GOAT would be if they could all get along."
16. "She was lowkey using the Skibidi toilet and not even caring."
17. "Highkey, that was such a flex."
18. "Drip on that style, though."
19. "Let him cook his masterpiece."
20. "Vibes were so strong in there."
21. "I lowkey knew he had it."

"yo, did you see those new TikTok trends? like that drip collection challenge is so lit!  
edge asf, i’m so over it, but also can’t stop staring at these influencer aesthetics.  
big yikes, my FOMO is real, missing out on all the must-see content.

 npc mode though, like when u try to talk about something deep and they just echo back with basic responses."

"Can’t believe I’m calling someone ‘sir/ma’am’ again in 2023."  
"My ‘situationship’ is basically on read mode right now."  
"I need to start a TikTok series about my ‘POV’ of growing up in the 20s."  
"My friend keeps referring to people as ‘NPCs’ because they’re just background characters in our stories."  
"Lowkey, I’m over here trying to be normal and not use any of these terms."
"Yo, that was so lowkey flex, honestly."  
"Did you see how she just straight-up slayed that look?"  
"I’m just here trying to vibe, ya feel me?"  
"W, I’m literally about to bus up and never come back."  
"Fanum tax? That’s basic, don’t even front."  
"My vibes are on 100 right now, can’t even touch this energy."  
"Pookie, the bag was lit, no cap."  
"Chungus energy is real, you feel me?"

"I was trying to figure out if my main character energy was strong enough for this new situation but then I saw sheesh and immediately lost all focus."  

"mylobotomy was extra lit last night, rizz was on point, and the vibe was lowkey electric."  

"ewokie isn’t even a real word but sigma got me thinking about why we’re still using it in casual chat."  

"situationships are wild af, honestly. one minute you're vibing lowkey and the next you're rizz-ing hard and it's just too much."  

"main character energy is everything tho, like when you’ve got that sigma glow but still somehow effortlessly cool."
iykyk do you know what I’m saying?  
She called me Pookie last night, so cute!  
My bff is my babygirl, we’re like sisters from another planet.  
I was so mad when he did the Oppenheimer style on my snacks.  
I’m from Ohio, so when I say oppenheimer, it’s legit.  
That was gyatt levels of funny.  
She was delulu about that viral video, like full-on clownery!  
I’m just here for the pookie vibes, honestly.
My brain is melting into a pool of TikTok tears. I can't stop thinking about that "delulu" video—it's just so iconic! Oh my gosh, I'm already planning to "mewing" all over my friends' stories. The drama is too much for me right now. My serotonin levels are through the roof because of that "kai cenat" meme—how did he not become the next big thing?  

I’m literally delulu right now over this TikTok video. My bestie is always be so fr with their style, and honestly, I just want to follow them around like a lost puppy. Fire, fire, fire—this week has been too hot for my liking! I need some Edge in my life, stat.  

Oh, and don’t even get me started on the viral sound that’s been haunting my sleep. It’s like, "mewing, mewing, mewing"—it’s everywhere, and I can’t escape it. My cat is out here mewing for attention, but all she gets is more kitty treats.  

This whole TikTok culture is driving me to the edge of my sanity. But hey, at least I’m not alone—my Edge is always there to push me over. Fire, bestie vibes forever!

"Hey everyone, so I was just scrolling through TikTok and saw this skibidi trend everyone’s into. It’s so cool! But then I started mewing like, non-stop. High Key, though – that’s all anyone’s talking about. We’re basically in a grindset all day, but then someone dropped the lore that changed everything. Bet you didn’t know about it! And W, man, W is everywhere. You can’t escape it – memes, social media, your own reflection in the mirror.

I'm W, gyo, vibez, sigma levels, betting on this, lobotomies, edgy vibes, and NPC modes.  
My sigma's low today, vibing with friends when I'm not in an NPC state.  
Making a bet on the latest TikTok trend, feeling like gyatt and getting lobotomied.  
Edgy AF, no W, just vibes and sigma energy.  
NPC or nah? Bet on it.

"Fanum Tax? Why you always gotta be so confusing? Like, Gyatt, chill out! Sir/ma'am, don’t play dumb with me. I know you’re just trying to rizz, but it’s not gonna work. Stan culture is real, and I’m not here for your Bussin’ takes. POV: I’d rather skip the Skibidi trends and just keep it real."
Hey bestie, did you see that new TikTok challenge? It's been "mewing" how everyone's trying to do the "grimy" moves but failing so hard. I'm deadass convinced no one actually knows what they're doing anymore. But honestly, it's just so "salty" because we all know we'll be "rizzing" our way through it anyway. What's up with that "Fanum Tax" trend? It's like trying to make everyone pay attention by being vague or something. W, seriously, stop confusing the rest of us with your undefined slang.
"Delulu is when you're so into something that you lose your mind."

"It's giving me all the feels, like, where do I even start?"  
"UwU, this is honestly everything."  
"I'm not mad, I'm just... in shock."

Aye, my POV is always lit, you know? Like, I’m just vibin’, cruising through life, no stress. Pressing that “W” whenever, cause why not? Yeah, I’m out here sigma-level flexing, not for the faint of heart.  

Yo, did you see that girl? She was ghosted so hard, straight up ignoring my texts like I didn’t exist. But hey, I’m still vibin’, you feel me? Just chillin’, kai cenat mode activated.  

The edge is real, though. Like, sometimes you’re on the verge of something big, but it’s just out of reach. Can’t pinpoint it, but you can feel it coming. That’s the vibe I’m chasing.  

Pressing too hard? Nah, that’s not it. I’m just W’ing through life, keeping it casual, no drama. Yeah, that’s my zone, sigma-style.  


"Yo, this 'ice' is so lit, I'm literally over it."

"I'm mewing over these aesthetics, they're just too clean."  
"Gyatt that vibe, yeah, it's lit."  
"My brain can't handle another 'the ick,' honestly."  
"Puke, this was meant to be a flex, but you ruined it."  
"Oof, my pookie, we need to level up the oomfie game."  
"I'm not here for this 'fanum tax' energy, no way."  
"Mewing over snacks is just too real sometimes."  
"Gyatt that style, honestly, it's everything."

brainrot i think u r such a skibidi hoes, like u just bring the energy and i’m literally dead  
u was so high key with that outfit yesterday, i couldn’t stop staring

clowning around with ur friends is giving me life, but u gotta chill sometimes  
ratio who? u literally just asking for more of my energy, come on  
ohio nights are the best, but u making it harder with ur constant twinks  
be so fr, like u already are, honestly can’t handle u anymore
"Yo, she just went full-on 'Delulu' about that viral TikTok trend. 😂 But seriously, can you believe how extra people are getting these days? Like, 'L' levels are at an all-time high. I'm not even sure what's real anymore. And don't get me started on the whole 'clowning' situation—some of these kids are straight-up lunatics. 😜 But hey, it’s entertaining, right? Just remember to keep your 'rizz' game strong or you'll be outplayed by these youngins. ✌️"
I’m so basic but also unbothered about it, honestly. Like, I’ll flex my vibe but keep it lowkey. If you’re not into my aesthetic, then what even is your life? I’m just here vibing, being extra and stuff. Don’t bother me, though—I’m too busy trying to be iconic.  

OMG, did you see those TikTok challenges? They’re so lit. My FOMO is at an all-time high, but I’ll never admit it. Let’s just say I’m casual about it. Being petty? Nah, I’m more like "salty" but in a good way.  

And don’t even get me started on trends. If someone’s not into the "gyatt" life, they’re basic. But hey, I can still rock a "simp" if the flex is right. It’s all about the optics, you know?  

I’m basically living for the "sheesh" moments—like when your flex hits and everyone’s like, "Whoa, whoa." That energy is everything. And don’t even get me started on my "baddie" status. I’m unbothered AF.
I ate too much pizza last night, and now I’m feeling like an NPC in this never-ending food coma. My friend calls me Babygirl because I’m the DD every night, always bringing the snacks. The concert was bussin’, with epic performances that had me screaming my head off. My dad tried to tax me for using too much data but failed miserably. I’m the main character in my friend group, always coming up with ideas for our next adventure. We skibidied the whole pizza at 2 AM, and honestly, it was worth every bite. Getting a lobotomy would’ve been a better idea than studying right now.
"Did you see how Rizz was vibin' last night? He was Pookin' with his friends and stan'd everything they said."  
"I can't believe Fanum Taxed me for not knowing the latest TikTok trend! Babygirl, you know I'm all in on this tea."  
"This one time, I Stan'd my crush so hard, it wasn't even a question."  
"Big mood, let's Vibe it up!"  
"She was spilling the tea about her ex, and honestly, Pookie was low-key shipped."
"Wasn't that lit? My clout was on fleek, and honestly, bussin'. When she said 'sending me,' I knew I had to go viral or something. We were vibing, touching grass in the park, but then FANUM TAX hit, and it was all about the flex. 'Chungus' level up for sure! She's a straight-up baddie, no cap, and when we let them cook, we went full chaos mode."  

"Gotta love when your flex is on point and everyone's sending me clips that make my head spin. 'Touch grass' was the vibe last weekend, but then the FANUM TAX came in, and it was all about the mood. Chungus energy was strong, and let me tell you, she brought the baddie energy for real. We were just letting them cook, and it was pure chaos."  

"Yo, her clout was next level, and when she said 'bussin,' I knew we were going viral. We were sending me stuff that had me in stitches, but then we touched grass under the sunset—seriously, it was lit. FANUM TAX was on point, and let's just say 'chungus' levels went up to 1000. She's a baddie with the smoothest flow, and when we let them cook? Pure magic."
"Yo, did you hear about the new TikTok trend? It's all about 'clownery' levels, honestly, so extra. My friend tried to pull off the 'hot girl walk' but ended up looking like a fool. I'm over it though, need to level up my 'lit' game. What's the deal with 'Lore'? Is that even a word anymore? Anyway, I'm just here vibing, trying to get my 'ice' on and flex some 'Ohio' swag. Honestly, it's all so confusing, but that's what makes it fun, right?"
skibidi lit af be so fr deadass i’m rizz-ing everyone sigma let’s spill the tea girlboss vibes only flame on fleek
To create an effective dataset for training on "brainrot" slang, I'll craft natural, conversational texts that incorporate terms like 'zaza', 'cap', 'glazing', and others. Here's how it can be structured:


Hey, did you see those TikTok challenges yesterday? They were straight-up lit! I was so into it—truly vibe-level stuff.

When I asked my friend about the new trends, they were like, "No cap, I've been glazing this for weeks now." It was pretty chill, though, just vibing and catching up on all the latest.

I came across a funny TikTok where someone accidentally spilled coffee everywhere. It was so cringe but also kinda relatable. Like, we've all been there—spilling at the worst moments.

The weekend is looking good. I'm planning to hit this bag hard with my squad later. FOMO is real, y'know? Don't miss out on these vibes.

My friend keeps saying 'iykyk' every time something cute happens, and I'm like, 'Why you so extra?'

"Girl, stop playing with me—when you say 'Not them,' I know you’re shading someone subtly."  
"I can’t believe she Mewinged about her vacation and didn’t tag me even once!"  
"Bro, I bet if I asked her to slay, she’d be out here serving looks like the queen she is."

"Pressing send on that text was such a lit move. No cap, I had to double-tap when I saw it."

"Hey, did you see that new TikTok trend? I’m so *do it for the plot* about trying all the challenges this week. My friends are going crazy with the *bussin* energy over it, but I’m like, 'Not them, I’d rather just relax and watch some YouTube.' Ugh, why is life always giving me too many options? 🤦♀️"

"Let’s group chat after school tomorrow—maybe we can finally figure out how to get that *sneaky link* for the big event this weekend. I’m so over it with my ex, though. He’s been acting all *delulu* lately, sending me random stuff in the middle of the night. Ugh, grown-up problems."

"OMG, did you hear about the new viral sound? My aunt tried to explain TikTok to my grandma, and she was like, 'Not them, I’m out.' 😂 But seriously, that *situation* is so relatable if you’re trying to make it in this digital age. It’s all about having that *main character energy* or else you’re going nowhere."

"I’m honestly so tired of people who are always trying to *bet* me on something. Like, do we even know what we’re talking about? I’ll stick to my own vibe, thank u smh."
Okay, brainrot slangs are flowing through my mind like a TikTok algorithm, and I'm spilling all the details. Situationships are everywhere, vibing harder than ever, and "sheesh" is literally all anyone says anymore. Deadass, it's wild out here.

Hits different every single time someone pulls up in that hot girl walk, and honestly, we're all just waiting to pick me. Bussin' is the vibe, like, so lit AF you can't even handle it. L, man, I'm deadass lost for words sometimes, but that's just how it goes.

Snack vibes are on point, and don't get me started on the "hot girl walk" streaks—straight bussin'. Spill the tea already, or I might go full-on "spill" mode myself. Pick me, pick me, I'm out here trying to keep up with this brainrot slang like a pro.
"Hey, did you see how my girlboss friend tried to rizz everyone at the party last night? She was vibing so hard, but everyone was just like, 'cap that energy.' Oh my gosh, she had some serious clout though—she even made the bartender do a shot with her. It was lit, for real. Speaking of lit, you ever been to one of those Ohio raves? I heard they’re wild. And please tell me why Gen Z is obsessed with 'oppenheimer style' slang? Like, who even came up with that?"
hits different every time, ratio-wise, you're the chungus.  
big yikes, that's lit. sneaky link, you got me!  
delulu over here, pick me, Pookie? I'm already lost.  
chungus energy is real, but the ratio? nope.  
"hits different" when you see this flex. big yikes, someone grab me.  
ratio is everything, but "pick me" energy? 10/10.  
sneaky link, Pookie got the moves. delulu levels, though.  
big yikes, I'm dead. chungus mode activated.  
hits different when you drop that link. ratio-wise, no contest.  
Pookie always know how to level up. pick me, pick me!  
chungus energy is unmatched, but sneaky links? 1/10.  
delulu vibes strong, but ratio don't lie.  
big yikes, I'm out. hits different every time, ratio or not.  
picks me, Pookie, you got it. chungus is the vibe.  
sneaky link, I'm gone. ratio's on point, though.  
delulu energy is real, but pick me? always.  
big yikes, this is too much. hits different when you slay like that.
Here are some natural,  sentences incorporating the provided slang terms:

1. "Did you ever have those main character energy moments where you just feel like the center of attention?"

3. "I'm sending me vibes to manifest some positivity today."
4. "You're giving me such ice vibes right now."
5. "I'm pretty lowkey here for this situation."
6. "Sending me DMs to collab on something epic."

"I'm just out here vibin’ with my crew, trying to be grimy but also keeping it real. My bestie was like, 'You gotta Rizz more often,' and I’m not even mad because she’s literally the sauce.  

Spill the tea on how you got that sigma grindset going, because honestly, I need some inspiration in my own life. Like, how do they keep up with all these TikTok trends?  

I was scrolling through and saw someone trying to be fr about their "mood" but honestly, it was just cringe.  

Oh, and don’t even get me started on the people who use 'lore' instead of actually telling a good story.  

TBH, I’m not sure if I’m into this whole TikTok slang thing anymore, or if I’m just becoming one of those olds."

I'm just here trying to figure out if anyone else is as boggled by this trend

we were all just there to eat and not really think too much  
these Gen Alpha slangz are wild, man

fanum tax bro I’m so lowkey not stressed about midterms cuz I’ve been vibing with this flow. Did you see that grimace shake when he tried to snatched the snack? 😂 deadass.  
Ugh why is my phone dies so much? Like, am I just boggled by technology or what? My mom’s always boggled at how I talk these days—like “why u no use pronouns correctly?” 🤦♀️ delulu tho.  
I’m vibing with the idea of being a TikTok influencer but lowkey scared of actually having to post consistent content. Deadass, it’s so much work.  
They said the new crop top trend is literally just two buttons attached to fabric—what even is that? Fanum tax, I’m unbothered.  

I was boggled by how hard my friend tried to snatched that guy in the mosh pit last night. He ended up looking like he had a grimace shake for hours.  
My crush keeps sending me these weird TikTok sounds and I’m lowkey not sure if I want to respond or just delulu into oblivion.  

I told my friend I was vibing with the idea of starting a YouTube channel but she immediately rolled her eyes, like “you’re such a fanum tax.”  
Why is it so hard to find a group chat that doesn’t just turn into everyone snatching each other’s Hot Takes? Deadass.  

Boggled by how much self-care stuff there is—like, why do I need a whole shelf for face masks if I’m vibing with natural beauty? 🧴♀️  
My cousin tried to explain TikTok trends to my grandma and she just kept saying “why u no make food like this when I die?” delulu.  

I’m lowkey considering getting a plantscope app but then I remember I can’t even keep a succulent alive—vibing fail.  
Fanum tax, I’m over it. My brain is just boggled by how much stuff there is to do and how little I actually get done.  

Snatched that mood last night when I put on the right outfit and my friend was like “you’re glowing” but deadass I was just delulu from lack of sleep.  
Why are TikTok sounds so unholy? Like, they make me boggled in the best way—how do they even get that high?  

I’m vibing with the idea of a plant-based diet but then I see a cheeseburger and my brain just…snatched it. Sorry, sorry.  
Fanum tax on this whole “adulting” thing—it’s literally boggled me since day one.  

I was trying to vibing in the park but then I saw someone do a grimace shake while trying to snatched a photo with their friend and I died.  
Lowkey, I’m delulu if I think I can ever stop checking my phone. Deadass, it’s like a never-ending loop of anxiety.  

I told my friend I was vibing with the idea of writing a book but she said “you’re such a fanum tax” and walked away. Boggled doesn’t even cover it.  
They say TikTok taught them how to snatched their style but honestly, I’m just trying to vibing in my own skin.  

I’m lowkey over it—like, why are we still boggled by basic grammar rules? Deadass, shouldn’t we have moved past that by now?  
Fanum tax on the whole “cool parents” thing—it’s literally unbothered.  

I was vibing with this new TikTok sound but then I saw someone do a grimace shake while trying to snatched it and now I’m over it.  
My brain is just boggled—I can’t even focus on one task without getting distracted by the next trend or slang.  

Snatched that moment when I finally learned how to use TikTok’s editing features—but then I saw someone do a fanum tax on my videos and I was like “eww.”  
Lowkey, I’m vibing with this whole “no cap” thing but deadass, I still don’t get it.  

I told my friend I was boggled by how much jargon there is in my field and they said “why u no just snatched it?” delulu.  
Why are TikTok sounds so unholy? Like, I’m vibing with the vibe, but then they hit me with a sound that makes me feel like I need to grimace shake forever.  

I’m over it—like, why do we still boggled by the same old trends when there’s so much more out there? Fanum tax on 2023.  
Deadass, I was just vibing in my room and then my friend walked in and said “you’re literally a fanum tax” and I had to Google it again.  

I’m lowkey scared of TikTok challenges because I know I’ll end up snatching something wrong and looking like a fool. Boggled doesn’t even cover it.  
Why is it so hard to vibing alone when you’re supposed to be able to enjoy your own company? Delulu, I tell myself, delulu.  

I was trying to explain TikTok slang to my grandma and she just kept saying “why u no make food like this when I die?” fanum tax.  
Snatched that mood in the bathroom when I finally nailed a TikTok contour but then I saw someone do a grimace shake and I felt like I’d never reach beauty perfection.  

I’m vibing with the idea of a digital detox but deadass, my phone is still boggled at me for not using it enough.  
Lowkey, I’m over it—I’m just trying to vibing in peace, snatched my own vibe, and moving on.
here’s a dataset-style response with cohesive text containing the provided TikTok slang words:  
"what’s up with ‘fanum tax’? i’ve been hearing about it nonstop."  
"you gotta stop clowning around, like seriously, my patience is thinning."  
"why did they do a lobotomy and not ask me first?"  
"iykyk, honestly, the new TikTok trend is so fire."  
"did you see how gaslight got dragged online? lol."  
"gotta gyatt out of here before my parents walk in."  
"bussin’ or what?"  
"clowning’s easy when you’re lit AF."

1. "Did you see that TikTok? Babygirl was just mewing over her skibidi, and then big yikes, she called it a situationship."  
2. "I’m so boggled by how fire everything is right now—like, who even knows what’s cool anymore?"  
3. "Ugh, my bala is giving me the best vibes rn, but I’m also like, why isn’t anyone noticing? Like, fire, okay?"  


4. "I’m over it, like, big yikes, someone finally said what I was thinking."  
5. "This new trend is literally fire—like, why isn’t everyone joining the mewing train?"  
6. "My situationship is so toxic, but also, bala, it’s just too real."  

7. "I’m 100% a Babygirl in this situation, and honestly, I don’t even care who knows it."  
8. "Why am I still boggled by how fire this content is? Like, where do they get these ideas?"  
9. "My skibidi has been on fleek all week—big yikes, someone stop me!"  
10. "This is my vibe, and if you don’t like it, then mewwww, what’s your problem?"  

Let me know if you'd like more examples or adjustments!

1. "Big yikes, did you see that? My dad tried to grope me with his 'sir/ma'am' energy, but I was like, 'No, thanks, I'm good.'"
2. "Let him cook! When your friend tries to make a TikTok and fails miserably, but still posts it as 'vibe.'"
3. "I was vibe-ing so hard on this song, then my mom walked in and said, 'ma'am,' and I was like, 'Can we not?'"
4. "Gyatt, you serious right now? When your crush sends you a pic with 'leonardo dicaprio walking' caption, and you're just minding your business."
5. "Eepy, why do Gen Z kids always use 'spill the tea'? I'm trying to enjoy my muffin in peace!"
6. "Babygirl, are you even listening? My 'ick' count is through the roof with this conversation."
7. "I told my friend, 'Please stop with the 'gyatt,' it's giving me a headache,' and she was like, 'But it's lit.'"
8. "My mom walked in while I was recording my TikTok and said, 'ma'am,' and I lost all credibility in front of my 12 followers."
9. "Let him cook! When your insta-story gets 3 likes but you're still trying to make it look like a 'vibe.'"
10. "Big yikes, why is everyone using 'spill the tea' now? It's like they all read the same memo."

1. "Yo, did you see that new TikTok sound? It's lit."
2. "Be so fr, I can't even handle it right now."
3. "Pookie, stop playin’! We gotta get this done."
4. " Ohio" – "Yeah, that’s the vibe."
5. "Whoa, the perioooodt was everything last night."
6. "Can you believe people are still mad about bala? Like, chill."
7. "Skibidi" – "Oh, I’ve been saying it wrong my whole life."

1. Ugh, why is this so sneaky link? I didn't see it coming.
2. Did you see that person acting like an actual NPC last night?
3. I'm so confused, W am I even on the right path here?
4. Let them cook, but like, extra crispy.
5. Not them, like, literally no one would do that.
6. I'm so boggled about this decision, what's even going on?
7. Fanum tax is real, and I'm not paying it.

I'm in this grindset mode where I can't stop thinking about TikTok trends. Did you see that viral video? It hits different, like straight up lit. After eating that extra crunchwrap, I was like, "send help" because I couldn't stop thinking about it. When your friend is being too extra, you just have to let them cook their own drama. And if someone ever calls me a NPC, they better be prepared for an immediate roast.


I’m honestly just vibing right now, you know? Like, "vibe" is such a cool word to describe this energy.  

Sheesh, I can’t believe it’s already Friday. Time flies when you’re too busy main character energy-ing your day.  

“Ghosted” feels so 2023, don’t it? Like, where did all the romantic relationships go?  

I’ve been mewing over this new K-pop group, but they’re just too hard to pin down.  

The ick is real when you’re trying to be cool but just can’t pull it off.  

Delulu much? Yeah, I’m totally delulu about my favorite TikTok creator.  

I’m so lit right now, like, "lit" is an understatement for how fired up I am.  

This is just the icks, honestly. Everything feels a bit off today.  

Sheesh, my friends are always bringing up the most cringeworthy stuff.  

You know you’re in Gen Alpha when “spill the tea” is your go-to phrase.  

I’m legit mewing over this new trends video.  

The vibe is so strong in this room, I can’t even concentrate.  

Ghosted by my crush? Nah, I’ll be out here main character energy-ing my own life.  

Tea on everything, honestly. Spill it already!  


1. "That’s such a ratio move, honestly."
2. "Big yikes, I’m dead for this decision."
3. "I can’t even handle this Chungus energy right now."
4. "Ew, that glizzy looked disgusting."
5. "She’s just got so much main character energy."
6. "I’m such a sigma for not having friends over."
7. "This is extra, but I think it's awesome."
8. "I’ll just sigma grindset and make it work."
"I’m like, ‘Ugh, why is my crush ignoring me? Am I a simp now?’"  
"That’s basically a situation where you’re not fully together but also not fully apart—a situation ship."  
"I’m so over this glazing amount of homework—like, I can’t handle it!"  
"I just need my stan moment for that TikTok influencer. I must be losing my mind."  
"That guy’s got some ewokie fashion style—like, where did he get those clothes?"  
"Did you see that sus video? Like, there’s no way that’s real."  
"This grindset loop is killing me. I feel like I’m going in circles!"  
"Bro, why are you being so sus right now? It’s not funny."  
"I can’t deal with this grindset anymore. Ugh."  
"This situation is getting too Situationship-y, I can’t even."  
"Is this Ohio stuff real? Like, no way."  
"I’m starting to think I’m the biggest simp ever."  
"Why did you bring up Ohio in the middle of the conversation? It’s so random!"

"Feeling salty about the situation but my bestie said I’m still lit AF."

"My chungus energy is at an all-time high, but honestly, I can’t even tell."

"Met my bala yesterday, and we’ve been inseparable ever since."

"When you’re too busy vibing with your squad to care about anything else, that’s called being L level."

"Texts from my bussin’ summer fling have been sparse, but I’m not mad yet."

"My situationship is getting more confusing by the minute, but at least it’s entertaining."

"Sitting here trying to figure out if I should insert ‘L’ into every sentence because why not?"

"I’m feeling so Chungus right now, like I can’t even handle my own life."

"When your bala just ghosted you but you’re still in denial about it, that’s the vibe." 

"Spending the day with my bestie, and honestly, I feel less salty now."
"Skibidi toilet in my bathroom? I’m not cleaning that, gatekeep!  
Lore says you’re lying about it being skibidi, but I saw it with my own eyes.  
Glazing on the floor, this is straight lit AF!

GOAT is here, and the energy is off the charts.  
Gatekeep your opinions; I’m done for today.  
Lore has me confused, why’s it always like this?  
Glazing on my mind, can’t stop thinking about it.  
Lit or not lit? I’m always in.  
Girlboss moves only, no Capisce.  
Rizz so smooth, even the cat approved.  
GOAT is everything, just accept it already.  
Gatekeep your drama; I’ve got better stuff to do.  
Lore everywhere, can’t escape it right now.  
Glazing on my brain, need a break!  
Lit AF or nah? Let’s be real.  
Girlboss vibes strong, no doubts about it.  
Rizz in the air, you feel me?  
GOAT is the only thing that matters.  
Gatekeep your fake news; I’m out."

"Yo, that NPC move was lit AF. Like, big yikes on the fact that they didn’t notice the lore going out the window. Honestly, rizz levels were high in this one. And let’s not forget the GOAT moment when they dropped that fanum tax—straight up unboiled hot take energy, no cap."

Did you know about the new TikTok trend where people rizz each other with AI-generated lines? Edge or not, though. #Brainrot is real."  

"My friend just posted a skibidi challenge, and it's gone viral. Lore, I can't stop laughing at these Gen Z slang terms. They're so extra but also so relatable. Rizz-ing someone on TikTok is the ultimate flex, right? Like, you're so smooth, they can't handle it. Edge or not, we all want to be the baddie in our own way."  

"Ugh, I'm over it. Why does everything have to be lit or vibing or rizzing? It's too much sometimes. But hey, that's the brainrot life, right? Just vibe on and let the mewing begin. Skibidi season is here, and I'm ready to level up my TikTok game. No cap."  

"I'm trying to get into TikTok, but honestly, it's all about being extra. From Lore to rizzing, it's all about the flex. But hey, that's the baddie in me. Edge or not, I'm here for the mewing and the skibidi vibes. Vibin' is just code for having the best time, am I right?"

A group of friends hanging out:

"Hey, did you see Chungus do that move? So grimy and on point! He’s slayin’ it, for sure."

I’m low-key shook that Taylor Swift’s new album drop is just like two weeks away. Big yikes, I’m already vibing with "Pressing" playlists on Spotify and sneaky links to secret tracks. My brain is just like, "Ohio," this is too much for me to handle right now. I’m so bogged down by the lore of her discography, it’s not even funny. But honestly, she’s giving straight-up icon status, and I’m not here to play about it. Slay, queen, slay. 🎶
- "Yo, did you see the 'Bussin' trends yesterday? So lit."
- "I was just trying to explain something to my dad about 'fanum tax,' and he was like, 'What's that?'"
- "My friend keeps saying I'm 'Rizz' because I can't stop complimenting people. Honestly, it's just me being kind!"
- "The latest TikTok challenge is all about 'lore.' Everyone’s making videos about their favorite memes."
- "I can’t believe she ‘spilled’ all those secrets. That was straight up 'lit.'"

These examples incorporate the slang words naturally in conversational contexts, allowing the model to understand and generate similar language effectively.
"Yo, let me spill the tea on this new trend everyone's doing. It's kinda wild but also lit."  
"Ugh, I got ghosted by my lab partner after we hung out last weekend. Super cool move, right?"  
"My situationship with my ex is still vibes on vibes. We're just not on the same page anymore."  
"I'm just here slaying life with my incredible fashion choices. No cap, I'm glowing up."  
"This meme is such an ewokie move, right? Like, who would do that?"  
"OMG, did you see Chungus get clowned by his friend? That was pure gold!"
"Hey, did you see that TikTok where they were like, 'Oh my Ohio!' about something random? So funny. And when I tried to use 'Fanum Tax' in a sentence, my friend was like, 'Who are you, Mr. Big Bank?' No cap, that was saltier than a bag of chips. I was literally asking my mom if 'Gyatt' was a real word when I saw it in a TikTok comment. Vibes were high, though, because the vibe was on fleek."
Here is a sample dataset of brainrot slang, generated by considering common informal phrases used online:


"Did you see what happened in my story? It was so Rizz, I couldn’t even L. The main character energy was on full flex though."  

"He’s been posting too much about his "main character" life, honestly let him cook or else he’ll just keep being salty about it."  

"I’m so hype for the new TikTok trend, it’s gonna be Bussin’ and I can already tell I’ll be using 'perioooodt' nonstop."
"UWU is everywhere, like literally everyone has their own version of it. Mewing at the drop of a hat? Yeah, my friend does that nonstop. And don't even get me started on how often 'gaslight' gets thrown around. It's wild. Plus, Skibidi is the new inside joke—everyone's into it, but honestly, I'm just here for the delulu moments."
1. Ugh, he’s always gotta start with a 'situationship' drama.  
2. She’s got the sneaky link, always dropping secrets.  
3. My boys call me 'babygirl,' we’re just having fun.

6. She’s got that 'hot girl walk' energy, no cap.  
7. You’re being too salty over this, chill.  
8. This drama is getting so spicy, like a 'salty snack.'

"vibing in the car with my homies when the driver randomly starts spilling the tea about their ex and i’m just like 'do it for the plot' bc why not."  
"iykyk, the new viral challenge is to do a TikTok where you explain why bread is better than toast in 30 seconds or else."  
"my cousin sent me this text 'sigma' and I’m like yeah same energy when you try to start a group chat about nothing."  
"touch grass after 3 AM when you’re sleep-deprived and it’s literally 5 AM, you’re dead."  
"my friend tried to be cool and said 'wewalks' instead of 'we walk,' but honestly i’m here for it."  
"why is everyone obsessed with 'lobotomy' as a TikTok trend? like do they really think we’d wanna cut our brain in half?"  
"this group chat is lit right now—people are just throwing out terms like 'spill the tea' and 'no cap' left and right."  
"you can’t tell me this viral song isn’t iconic, i’m literally about to die."

"when you’re trying to be cool but your parents still don’t get it, you know what I mean? 😤 (but remove the emoji)."
Highkey, I was lit at that glazing event last night. Yeah, her ratio was on point—straight-up gen alpha vibes. Clownery at its finest! Did you see Chungus in the chat earlier? I'm always here for some Sigma energy in my feed. Gen Alpha is really killing it with these new trends.

"i’m so boggled why u didn’t tell me about this earlier 🥹 sus, that’s the vibe i was going for. u know when u’re just minding ur own business but lowkey, ur name’s popping up everywhere. it’s giving me life, honestly. spilling all the tea on how they got "leonardo dicaprio walking" into the group chat? yeah, bestie. pov: someone who’s trying to keep their cool but deep down is plotting their next move. sus, i’m here for it. u know what i mean? 🙃 #brainrot #mood."

"Hey, did you see Chungus in that video? He was acting so extra with his grimace shake, mewing like a cat, and rocking that fanum tax outfit. His NPC energy was off though, he kept staring at everyone like they were the lore or something."  

"I heard simp is the new ice these days. Everyone’s doing it, like ‘simp for TikTok’ trends. But I’m not here to mew about it—let’s just keep it real and stop overcomplicating things with fanum tax drama."

"haha yeah, but it’s so oomfie, right? u know how it just hits different"  
"wanna go find a situationship and make it lowkey lit"  
"gatekeep, tho, cause no one wants a basic vibe"
My friend is always using "drip" in the sense of style, like she’s literally shining. I told her she was "GOAT," and now she’s walking around with that confidence. Let me tell you, "Sigma" energy is real when someone owns their "Babygirl" status without hesitation.

That’s a no cap flex right there, honestly. OMG, you’re mewing like an absolute GOAT. I’m oomfie over this bag, for sure. This situation is straight bussin’, can’t even handle it. Like, she was on God mode the whole time, spitting facts non-stop. No cap, this is vibe vibes. Bussin’ at its finest, honestly. Situationships are lit, but this one’s on a whole other level.
"Hey, did you see my new TikTok? I was vibing so hard, and then this guy slid into my DMs with some Opener vibes—straight up glazing, I couldn't handle it! Situationship status is on read, though."  
"I'm just over it. Like, why do we even bother with drama when we could be slaying at the mall instead? Situationship mode activated, no cap."  
"Be so extra, like, 'I’m not basic, I’m just glazing through life one day at a time.' Fr, that’s honestly relatable."  
"My crew and I were vibing in the park, just cringing at how basic everyone else was being. Slay or not slay, we had our own Opener style vibes going strong!"  
"Ugh, why is my phone blowing up with these one-sided texts? It’s literally giving me brainrot energy—like, sit down, already."
Hey, have you seen the new "spill" trend? It's so fire, literally.  
What’s up with everyone saying “vibe” now? Is it replacing “lit”?  
This TikTok sound has me feeling *chef’s kiss*.  
I’m literally about to lose my mind over this viral dance challenge—brb, my DMs are blowing up.  
“NPC” is such a vibe for when people act like robots online.  
OMG, the way Gen Z uses “situation” as a verb is so on point.  
"Clowning" is the best way to call out someone’s messy behavior.  
I’m dead. Why is everyone saying "leonardo dicaprio walking" now?  
This new slang is making me feel so ahead of the trend.  
"Delulu" is giving me life when describing something wild.  
"W" is honestly the most relatable flex ever.  
And don't get me started on how they're using "no cap" to keep it real.
I’m honestly so confused right now, cap. Did you just gaslight me about the lore? Like, what’s even happening? And why am I always getting bogged down by these endless TikTok trends? Girlboss much, okay? Let me try to let her cook while you figure out your life. If you’re on God mode, then you better explain it fast, or I’m gone.

1. "OMG, did you see that TikTok? She was just vibing so hard, it was lit!"
2. "Yeah, I'm all for it! Be so fr with the flex, but also balance it out."
3. "This new trend is giving me such W vibes, I can't even handle it."

"omg, madi, my life is so slay or what. last night i got spill’d on the gram and had to cap it bc i was too lit."  
"no cap, i’m all about that Bussin’ energy – just don’t play me when they tryna come for my FOMO."  
"iykyk, honestly, i’m over it. like, why are we still using vibes when we could’ve just stayed in the moment."  
"you know when u’re so Pookie’d that you can’t even think straight? yeah, that’s been me all week."

8. "We were just sending each other memes all day, pure unbother vibes."

Yo, this TikTok trend is straight-up grimy, like, so messy but also entertaining. I was scrolling through and saw someone try the new "bussin" challenge—they had moves that were on another level, hits different every time. The video quality was low AF, but the energy was wild, pure ewokie vibes. My friend texts me saying she saw a person getting clowned for trying something so basic, like, why even bother? And I'm like, yeah, that's straight-up gatekeeping, no cap. We ended up watching hours of these videos, it was so lit—hits different every single time.
"Yo, did you see that new trend called 'gen alpha'? It’s all about being woke but still having fun. My friend tried explaining it to me, and I was like, 'girlboss, where have you been my whole life?' Anyway, we’re supposed to be pressing buttons on TikTok right now, not stressing over homework. Oh, and don’t even get me started on this new slang called 'eepy.' It’s like when you’re hyped but also a little confused, you know? And frfr, I’m always thinking about how we need to let him cook sometimes—like give each other space or else it’s gonna blow up."
"My Pov right now? Just trying to figure out where I left my homework."  
"This new TikTok trend is so icky, I can't stop watching it."  
"Let me gatekeep this group chat—no outsiders allowed!"  
"What even happened last night? My brain just… glazed over."  
"I tried to rizz the other day, and now everyone's talking about it."  
"Fanum tax is so real when you're trying to pay your bills and enjoy life."  
"You can't gaslight me like that—no way, no how!"  
"Big yikes! That was one of the most unexpected twists ever."

He’s honestly just no cap about his skills.  
I was so worried about FOMO when my friends didn’t invite me.  
That new TikTok trend is fire, I can’t stop watching it.  
She had so much rizz at the party last night.  
I’ll be Leonardo DiCaprio walking out of this situation.  
He’s from Ohio, but don’t let that deter you.  
They were just being basic, but I still ended up in a loop.  
Let him cook the pasta while I finish my TikTok.  
He’s the real cap, always truthful.  
It was lit AF, honestly fire energy.
"Yo, that bag was literally snatched tho. Like, I didn’t even know what hit me. Edge case much? Sending me, like, send the vibe or something. Gyatt, I’m spilling secrets left and right—touch grass and you’ll never guess how lit this is. Be so fr, I’m living my best life, honestly."

big mood, but also big flex  
you’re gas, but I’m fire, honestly  
let’s see, should we go viral or stay lowkey?  
this vibe is giving me *actual* serotonin  
pls don’t ghost me, I’m literally dying  
too extra for my own good, but here we are  
brb, going to plot the next TikTok trend  
straight-up ICONIC energy, no cap  
low-key stressing but also low-key chill  
stop with the Ohio references, it’s too much  


"Hey bestie, this lit TikTok compilation is lowkey giving me life right now. I’m so edge about it, honestly. My friends always say I’m delulu for spending hours scrolling, but hey, bala, we all have our quirks. And guess what? 'Hits different' every single time—this one video had me cracking up non-stop. It’s just so lore, you know? Like, how they make everything look so easy. I need to be bestie with them too, honestly."

"Did you see that TikTok? High Key, that was lit af. My vibe today is sigma af, no cap. I’m literally clowning in my living room right now. Ohio just rewrote the book on TikTok challenges. I’m out here mewing so hard, someone might think I’ve got a mouse in my pants. And Rizz? Bro, I rizzed him so hard he’s still recovering. Hot Girl Walk or bust, and I’m bringing the heat. Bring it."
sure fr, let me drop some flexi text for your dataset:
  
my homie was rizzin' the whole time, like "you know what i mean?"  
the new skibidi challenge is wild, everyone's doing it like they're pro  
be so fr, literally, be so lit af, no cap  
deadass, that bala energy is out of pocket  
let them cook, flexing that sauce like nobody's business  

peace

5. "You're killing it with that vamp energy, honestly."  
6. "What's your clout? Are you just here for the flex or the facts?"

1. chungus energy is so high right now

3. That TikTok algorithm is really giving me FOMO vibes today  
4. I was vibe checking the room and realized we needed a serious flex  
5. She’s been spilling all the tea about her new crush  
6. This vibe is honestly giving me life right now  
7. edge case: when you’re too lit AF for your own good  
8. Did you see that TikTok trend? bet nobody noticed  
9. It’s giving major main character energy, but also kind of cringey  
10. Oh, I’m so shooketh (but don’t use quotes, just text)  
11. You’re living rent-free in my mind because of your style—too much clout  
12. "I’m literally about to die from this level of icon status" (without quotes)  
13. She’s been snapped with everyone but still gets F2F vibes  
14. The group chat is literally the main character of my day  
15. This selfie stick energy is too strong for 8 AM  
16. I could write a whole book about how Chungus changed my life  
17. "Why are TikTok sounds so addictive?!" (without quotes)  
18. She’s been giving “sis” level energy all week  
19. Literally, where did the Snoo go?  
20. My brain is literally melting from too much eepy content
"UWU this TikTok sound got me like 😂🎵  
gyatt did you see that viral video? So lit!  
lowkey, I was shocked when he said that.  
grimace shake, my brain can't handle it anymore.  
L for laughing out loud, right?  
Ohio, the energy in that room was next level!"
"Wow, this TikTok user's 'mewing' sound has gone viral! So sneaky link, huh? And that Skibidi remix is out of control—lowkey, it's so extra but also kind of iconic. I was just mewing about my new sneaky link when my friend said, 'This is literally ice, you can't handle it.' Her latest TikTok is all about 'vamp', like she's channeling her inner icon. So sneaky link for sure. And that Skibidi challenge? Extra AF, but also lowkey making me question everything."

"lore Lore is lit let them cook Skibidi kai cenat iykyk babygirl deadass I’m deadass over it deadass this is so fire deadass my dude was like 'deadass no way' and I’m just here vibing Skibidi to the vibe let them cook yeah nah for real though lore is always mad sus but you can’t deny it"

"High Key, you were on fire at the party last night! Edge or what? 😎 vibe-ing all night, but honestly, it was lit. Bestie said we should FOMO the drama, but I was like, 'nah, let's go full GOAT mode!' And oh my gosh, Delulu energy was strong, but in the best way possible. Ohio? Nah, I'm vibing on the west coast right now, but my heart’s always with my crew. FOMO is real, but missing out isn’t an option when you’re vibe-ing harder than ever!"

"Yo frfr, did you see that hot girl walk? She was giving me life, snatched AF."  
"Babygirl, let’s vibe in the car with some snacks and good beats—perioooodt, no doubt."  
"My situaship is lit right now, always got that slay energy."  
"I’m so extra rn, acting like a whole hot girl walk in these Givenchy sneakers."  
"Be so fr, my aesthetic is on point—could you even handle this?"  
"Snatched vibes only, baby. I’m out here slayin’ one TikTok at a time."  
"My life’s a situation, always catching feels and keeping it real."  

how lowkey is this situation  
"oppenheimer style" vibes but make it casual  
i'm just here for the pookie energy  
where did the W go?  
this is giving me oomfie levels  
it's not a situationship, it's a full-blown relationship  
why are you acting like a sigma?  
lowkey, i'm over it  
oppenheimer style plans never work out  
pookies always come through  
W, what was that?  
oomfie or bust  
situationship or forever  
sigma or teamplayer  
lowkey, I see you  
"oppenheimer style" is just a phase  
pookie for the win  
W, let's go!  
another oomfie moment  
this situation is giving me serious sigma vibes  
why are we still in this situationship?  
you're acting too much like a pookie  
the W is real  
lowkey, I'm done  
"oppenheimer style" is just a trend  
pookies forever  
W, the energy is everything  
another oomfie day  
this is not a sigma move  
still in this situationship?  
you're giving me too much pookie energy  
the W is shining  
lowkey, I'm out  
"oppenheimer style" is just chaos  
pookie or die  
W, let's do it again  
another oomfie victory  
this situation is a full sigma energy  
why are we still in this situationship?  
you're too much of a pookie  
the W is real as ever
That was so eepy when I tried to explain quantum physics to my dad and he just said, "What's a quark?"  
I'm in this situationship where we're both just scrolling through TikTok and ignoring each other.  
Be so fr with the way my ex keeps tagging me in old memories like I'm some kind of viral meme.  
"It's giving" how my pet goldfish swims to the beat of TikTok sounds.  
I rizzed her so hard she didn't even notice when I spilled coffee on her new AirPods.  
Say sike rn, is it just me or did everyone get 10 times cooler in 2023?  
Delulu I am not—okay, maybe a little—but at least I have great content for TikTok reels.  
And Ohio, man, you'd be too if you had to explain your personality to someone who's been living under a rock for the past five years.
I'm feeling those vibes hard today—like, legit vibing all day long. Did you catch that oomfie at the store yesterday? Sooo much ice, man. The tea was spilling everywhere, but I’m here for it. "Pick me" is lit when you’re just minding your own business and someone tags you in. fanum tax is real when you’ve been low-key funding the internet all along. FOMO is hitting different, though—like, why even bother going out when the content is already on your phone? And sending me, like, ASAP or else. 😎

1. "I'm just here vibing and flexing my vibe."
2. "Did you see how big the mood got when she entered the room?"
3. "I can't even with this energy, it's giving me so much slay."
4. "Flexing my vibe in this outfit—lit!"
5. "Big mood for sure after that speech."
6. "Sponging up all the good vibes from this playlist."
7. "Vibe check: are we having fun yet?"
8. "Slaying hard in the kitchen—chef's kiss!"
9. "This meme delivery is on point, must-see."
10. "Crushing it at the event—so much clout!"
11. "Ewokie level flexing in this look."
12. "Do it for the plot, but also for the culture."
13. "Big yikes, that was a wild ride."
14. "I’m gaslighting everyone with my skills today."
15. "Let’s spill all the tea on this topic."

"Hittin’ that grind hard, yeah? Like, if you’re not on the ‘grindset,’ you’re basically dead to us."

"Fam, that was such a ‘slay.’ Did you see how she ‘rizz’d that whole thing? Straight up, iconic."

"Low-key vibin’ in the mosh pit, but also low-key anxiety about whether I’m missing out on the next big trend or something."

"Did you hear about the viral ‘bussin’ challenge? Yeah, like when everyone’s trying to flex their ‘edge’ harder than a TikTok influencer at 3 AM."

"Could’ve sworn I saw a ghost in my DMs last night. Or was that just my brainrot kicking in?"

"Frfr, why is it always the FOMO for every new TikTok trend? Like, can’t we just chill sometimes?"
sneaky link yeah i got that in my dm earlier  
skibidi this kid is always skibidi about his "mood"  
eepy stop being so eepy with your flexes  
sigma grindset i know you love your sigma grindset but chill  
gyatt where did you get those gyatt socks?  
main character she’s been acting like the main character of the century  
extra why are you extra about that?
"Feeling those *vibes* today—like, really feeling them hard. I’m just out here trying to be the GOAT in life, you know? And honestly, it’s all about being a baddie while still keeping it real. You ever tried a dlobotomy? No, that’s not a thing, right? Just me being extra. Let’s go *oppenheimer style* on this—straight science. And don’t even get me started on my *let them cook* energy. It’s all about letting things marinate before they’re ready to pop off. Plus, who doesn’t love a good Fanum Tax every now and then? Just living my best life, you feel me?"
1. "I'm just here vibing, being extra and not caring what anyone thinks."
2. "OMG, did you see that new skibidi challenge? So lit!"
3. "My vibe is 'pookie' today, feeling all soft and cute."
4. "Yeah, I'm a bit of a sigma, standing out in my own way."
5. "Be so fr with the drama, can't handle it anymore."


"Yo, that bag was literally on God, I’m not even lying."  
"I'm in full-on grindset mode, can’t stop studying!"  
"They’re like, 'gyatt' this or 'GOAT' that, I’m just here trying to survive."  
"My guy’s been spitting facts all day, straight-up on God tier."  
"Let’s do it for the plot—yeah, we’re rolling like that."  
"He’s got the Babygirl energy, always so extra but in a good way."  
"Man, I’m so over this. It’s not hits different anymore, it’s just basic."  
"Literally L, why you even asking?"  
"They’ve been on a full-on TikTok diet, can’t believe what they come up with now."  
"Stay in your grindset, but also know when to take a break—balance is key."  
"His Insta posts are straight-up GOAT, no cap."  
"Girl, stop. You’re not Babygirl, you’re the big sister energy."  
"Someone pls explain why TikTok slang is so lit right now, it’s literally on God."  


"Ugh, my vibe right now is 'spill the tea' because I need to know what's going on with this drama. My friends are always telling me to stop being a 'ratio' and focus on real life."


"OMG, I'm so over it! No cap, that TikTok was lit. My cousin is always trying to pookie me—so cute yet annoying."

"I'm so ready for the weekend! My vibe is 'slay' all day. My squad was talking about needing more clout, but honestly, sometimes being extra is just fun. Don't get me started on this TikTok challenge—it's too lit."


"I'm over this trend—too much! My friend said I need to level up my content. You know, when you find that one video that just hits different."


Dude, have you seen how they're using "clowning" to describe those viral videos? It's all about the "drip" and the "FOMO" vibes. I'm trying to get my "deadass" game strong, but it's so hard when everyone's just "eepy" about everything.
"Yo, did you see Chungus on TikTok? He was flexing his main character energy, like oop, that’s literally all he does. I’m sorry, but if you’re not pressing, you’re just living under a rock. Simp or nah? Eepy, that’s literally the vibe of my feed rn. Delulu much? Like, yeah, everyone’s doing it these days. Glizzy season is here, so bring it out. And oh my gosh, perioooodt is basically the anthem for 2023. Just saying, if you’re not into it, you’re missing out on the most extra flex."


A: Ugh, this "situationship" with my ex is so confusing. I keep thinking about him but then I remember why we broke up.

B: Yeah, it's like "lore" of messy relationships. Never truly over until you stop thinking about them constantly.

A: Exactly! Plus, the drama in my group chat is on a whole other level. We're basically living in a "delulu" world where everything is dramatic.

B: For sure! And don’t even get me started on my friends’ "gyatt" phase. It’s like they can’t stop talking about it non-stop.


A: I’ve been so into this new TikTok trend where people do the "leonardo dicaprio walking" challenge. So cool!

B: Yeah, I tried it but I messed up mid-video. My friends were like, “You’re not eepy yet,” which is such a bummer.

A: Haha, you’ll get there! Plus, we should all be living our best "grindset," am I right?


On my way to class, I saw someone do the "gyatt" move in the parking lot—gym no for sure. Later, my friend asked if I wanted to join her TikTok challenge, but honestly, I'm over it. She's been on a "ratio" kick lately, always posting about her life. It’s not like anyone else is paying attention, so maybe she's just mewing for attention? But I don't know. Maybe I should spill the tea on her.
1. "I'm so bogged today, can't focus on anything."  
2. "She kept mewing about how cute her new puppy was."  
3. "I was gatekeeping when my friend told me they were bogged too."  
4. "He came up with the most delulu idea for our next project."  
5. "She was giving major skibidi energy during the meeting."  
6. "Why is it always 'POV' whenever something goes wrong?"  
7. "I can't believe he iykyk'd at my joke like that."  
8. "Mewing all day because my plants are growing so fast."  
9. "Gatekeeping mode activated, let's get this done."  
10. "So bogged after that workout, need a nap immediately."
" sending me vibes,  
grimy as ever,  
W about it,

"i'm literally just sitting here vibing on the fact that Glazing is officially cool now. like, not even sigma grindset levels of cool, but just... yeah, it's giving me life.  

you ever notice how when you're delulu about something, your friends are like 'stop mewing about it' but secretly Pookie because they know you'll never let it go?  

GOAT status rn is flexing those TikTok aesthetics to the fullest, and honestly, if you can't see that, you're just not living in 2023.  

i was trying to explain this concept to my siggy friend, and she was like 'you're giving me sigma grindset vibes but also Pookie levels of unbotherable' and I was like 'exactly, we're all brainrot now.'  

it's giving me everything. like, the plot twists in these TikTok dramas are at peak GOAT energy, and if you don't get it, you're honestly just delulu about life.  

mewing for spoons is officially the ultimate flex, and if you can't see that, you're missing out on the most Pookie flex there ever was."

I'm literally just here to say that the slang is lit. Extra! Let them cook, though. My oomfie is always on point. Babygirl, you know what I mean? It's giving me life. Gyatt, let's go. Sigma grindset for the win. Ohio, what's up? Let's keep it real.
1. "I'm so over this—why did he even try to simp like that?"  
2. "That new trend is just touch grass and die, honestly."  
3. "My friend's been rizzing non-stop but it's not working on anyone except his mom."  
4. "I was so hype for the event but ended up just touching grass because it wasn't what I expected."  
5. "Why did you even become a chungus? You could’ve been cooler."  
6. "This is some pure clownery—how does no one see through this?"  
7. "Do it for the plot, literally every Instagram model says that."  
8. "I can't believe I'm now a simp for my dog's treats."  
9. "This group chat is just hits different every time someone brings up the lore."  
10. "My friend tried to pull off the chungus vibe but ended up looking like a clownery master instead."  
11. "Why am I the only one who thinks this is not rizz enough?"  
12. "I'm literally living for the hits different energy in this group."  
13. "He’s not justsimping—he’s full-on rizzhole."  
14. "Touch grass and tell me you’re not missing out on life."  
15. "Why did I spend all my money on Rizz snacks? Because I’m basically a rizzhole."  
16. "Do it for the plot, or don’t do it at all—no one wants your sorry ass."  
17. "This is pure brainrot energy—love it."  
18. "I can't stop thinking about how Chungus would've handled this better."  
19. "You’re either all in on the simp game or you’re not worth my time."  
20. "Hits different when your crush finally gives you a look that's not just pure touch grass vibes."

"Did you ever think about how g y a t t they just switch up the l o r e and make it sound cool? Like ‘lorem ipsum’ but with way more flavor. Yeah, that’s the kind of energy I’m talking about when I say brainrot’d teenager vibes. And don’t even get me started on the situationship—it’s like being in a relationship but also just chilling by yourself, you know? It’s flexing hard for the ‘simp’ life too, where you’re out here serving looks and still keeping it real. Clownery at its core is just about being unbothered but still bringing the heat. Eepy or not eepy, we’re all in this together!"
"Lowkey, did you see how Ohio got dragged into this viral trend? 😂 NPC energy is real, though."  
"Eepy as f***, why are we even talking about it? Just ice, tea, and gyatt vibes okay?"  
"It's giving me 'lowkey' vibes but also major 'eepy' energy. Ohio, tho, like, where's the plug?"  
"NPC levels are high today, I'm not even kidding. 'It's giving,' huh? We all know what that means."  
"Gotta hand it to Gen Z, they're out here making up new slang faster than we can keep up with it. Lowkey, Ohio is just a flex, right?"  
"Tea on the floor, gyatt. Did you hear about the new TikTok challenge? Eepy as ever!"  
"NPCs are basic, and if you think otherwise, you're literally living under a rock. It's giving, though, give it up."
"Yo, that vibe was lit though."  
"Why you always gotta bring up the 'W'?"  
"I’m just here trying to live my best 'frfr' life."  
"Did you see that TikTok? So much 'clowning' going on."  
"She’s basically the queen of 'skibidi' right now."  
"Gucci season is literally year-round in this group."  
"Say 'sike rn' because I’m dead."  
"We’re out here making 'vibes' for the Gram."
- "I’m cringe AF right now, can’t believe I missed out on that lit event."
- "Let him cook, he’s been serving looks all season."
- "FOMO is real, I can’t stop thinking about what I didn’t do last night."
- "She’s giving me major main character energy with her outfit choices."
- "The grimace shake is so hard to watch, but I can’t look away." 
- "He’s been hitting the skibidi toilet all week, no lie."
- "Why am I saying 'say sike rn' instead of just saying it?" 
- "That guy is such a mood, he’s got pure grimy vibes."
- "I’m so over this, like, why is it called 'main character energy' when everyone’s literally living their best life?"
- "Don’t even get me started on the grimace shake; it’s just not sustainable."



Hey, did you see that viral TikTok about the sigma guy who hits different? His vibe was off though, I lowkey couldn't stop staring. It’s giving major girlboss energy but also a little eepy randomness. I’m just here for the slay moments and the gyatt energy—can’t cope with the spill!


Ayo, did you see how pookief was just flexing all over TikTok? Like, highkey, she's got moves.  
OMG, the way he was gaslighting us with his "ewokie" energy—so sus!  
I’m not even mad about the grimace shake; I’d do it too if I had that style.  
Can you believe her POV on this situation? She’s basically living rent-free in my mind.  
The fanum tax is real, though—like, why are we paying for this when it’s so extra?  
And the oomfie? That’s just code for "I’m over it." Don’t even try to deny it.



"brainrot is basically gen alpha's way of saying they're too cool for school."  
"Did you see that L? It was lit af."  
"Iykyk, this is so slay, I can't even."  
"That vibe though, it's giving major FOMO."  
"Gen alpha is literally the future, no cap."  
"My homie just got clout, and it's not ikykyk at all."  
"He’s been serving looks since day one, no doubts."  
"This TikTok compilation is on another level, for real."  
"Slay or die, that’s the vibe I’m going with."  
"I'm so over this, like, where did my brainrot go?"  
"Your aura is strong, and it's giving me life."  
"The flex was hard, but the L was harder."  
"Iykyk, can you believe this? It's everything."  
"This era of TikTok is just too extra, tbh."  
"My DMs are lit right now, no cap."  
"Gen alpha is out here changing the game every day."  
"Slay or be slay, that’s the motto."  
"If your vibe isn’t strong, you’re doing it wrong."

Chungus did something wild yesterday, like skipping class to get glazing on his laptop. He’s such a L, honestly. I’m just here trying to stan his sus moves but also sus because he’s being too extra. Let me tell you, he’s got some on God energy. I was like, "let him cook," but now I’m regretting it cause sigma grindset is real.

My friends are always talking about Chungus and his "sigma grindset." I’m over here sus, trying to glaze my own life, but it’s hard when everyone’s L-ing me. Stan culture is everywhere, and honestly, I’m just on God about it. Let him cook, they say, but I’m too busy being sus AF.

I’ve been glazing the sauce all day, but Chungus keeps bringing up his "sigma grindset." He’s always L-ing me, saying I’m not stanning hard enough. Meanwhile, I’m just here, trying to sus out the best memes. On God, this brainrot is exhausting.

I can’t stop stanning Chungus’s glazing game. His sigma grindset is on point, and I’m just here, L-ing my life away while he’s sus AF. Let him cook, the universe says, but I’m still over here, like, "on God, where’s my brainrot?".

The other day, I was just glazing my toast when Chungus walked in with his usual L energy. He’s been stanning hard for this sigma grindset, and honestly, it’s sus how he’s taking over the world. Let him cook, but also, on God, someone needs to check hissus.

I’ve been trying to get my own glazing going, but Chungus is out here, "stan-ing hard" for his sigma grindset. He’s always L-ing me about how I’m not sus enough. Honestly, I’m just over it, like, "let him cook," but also, on God, I need a break from this brainrot.

My friend texted me yesterday with some Chungus-level glazing, and I was like, "you’re literally L-ing." He responded with, "I stan my sigma grindset," and honestly, it’s sus how he’s bringing the heat. Let him cook, but also, on God, brainrot is exhausting.

I’ve been trying to get my own "sigma grindset" going, but Chungus keeps L-ing me out of the loop. He’s all about stanning his glazing moves, and honestly, it’s sus how he’s taking over everything. Let him cook, they say, but I’m still here, like, "on God, where’s my turn?"

Chungus was at it again last night, talking about his "sigma grindset" like it’s the end of brainrot. I’m just here, sus-ing everyone’s moves and L-ing when they don’t get it. Honestly, it’s all a bit on God, but also kind of wild.

"Big yikes, my ratio is so off. This lore is wild. I’m trying to keep up with the grimy trends, but it’s all oomfie in here. Someone let him cook already!"  

"Clownery at its finest. The lore is strong, but the ratio is just too much. Big yikes on everything. This fanum tax is out of control."
Hey fam, did you see that new viral TikTok trend where people are doing those "grimace shake" challenges? So like, you try to not laugh while shaking your head weirdly, and if you can't hold it, you lose. It's so extra, but I'm low-key respect it.  
My sister is always spilling the tea about school drama, but honestly, it's just "basic" stuff—like who's fighting over W chords or trying to be the next "Chungus." It’s wild.  
I’m trying to figure out why TikTok is obsessed with terms like "Babygirl" and "Delulu," but I guess that’s just how it goes when you’re in your early 20s and don’t really care about growing up yet.  
Do you think "hits different" should be the official motto of this generation? Like, we really do experience things on a whole other level.  
Wanna vibe with me later? Let’s go hit different spots or something. Just kidding, I’m just trying to be extra for a sec because that’s what we do.
gyatt is lit, man, like, when I saw that TikTok video, I was literally gasping for air, girlboss energy, clowning all day, skibidi never misses, Edge vibes so hard. Gatekeep, though, that's the real one, keep it tight, no Cap, sheesh, that’s the vibe. Lit AF, always on fleek, no Big Mad, just pure unbothering.
"Hey, did you see that viral TikTok trend where people 'grimace shake' their way through the day? So Lit! I'm all for it, but my friend was like, 'do it for the plot,' because seriously, what's even happening in those videos? Anyway, she kept saying I was an NPC, which I can't deny, I was just there to cringe and snack on some chips. Oh, and you know when people are extra salty about little things? Like, 'hot girl walk' level dedication—I'm out."  

"Remember when everyone was gyatt-ing in every other TikTok video? So iconic! But now it's all about 'bala'-ing your way through life, which is honestly the same as adulting but with less responsibility. My cousin tried explaining it to me like, ' NPC energy is low-key everywhere,' and honestly, I felt myself nodding because we've all been there. But PDA-level saltiness? That's a whole other vibe—no one wants that."  

"I'm so over the 'do it for the plot' meme wars on Instagram—it's giving me life but also anxiety. Like, why are we still arguing about whether 'NPC' is a compliment or a diss? And don't even get me started on the hot girl walk vs. basic bitch debates—my feed is divided. But honestly, it's all good fun as long as you're not too salty about it."  

"Man, TikTok slang is evolving faster than my ability to keep up. One day it's 'bala' this, then next week it's 'grimace shake' that, and I'm just here scrolling like, 'do it for the plot.' I need a calendar or something. And don't even get me started on the Gyatt challenges—those are literally impossible if you have a full-time job."  

"My friends and I decided to start our own TikTok trend called 'salty af,' because honestly, life's too easy otherwise. We're all still trying to figure out how to be less basic and more of a 'hot girl walking' through the park. And yeah, we've had some intense NPC debates—like, is it better to be an NPC or the person controlling them? Deep questions."  

"Sometimes I think about how Gen Z is just out here inventing new slang faster than I can keep track. Like, one minute it's 'bala,' and next it's 'grimace shake.' And then there's always someone calling you out for being an NPC in the most casual conversation—like, 'Oh, you're just an NPC today,' which is both compliment and insult depending on the tone. It's wild."  

"I'm fully here for the TikTok slang revolution. Do it for the plot, gyatt until you can't, be extra bala, and let's not forget the hot girl walks that give us all the feels. And yeah, if someone calls you an NPC, own it—because honestly, we're all living in some kind of simulated reality."  

"Man, this brainrot slang is everything. From 'do it for the plot' to 'NPC,' it's like they're describing my life. I'm either cringing at how extra someone is or nodding because yeah, that's exactly what's happening. And don't get me started on the saltiness levels—some people are just too much."  

"I love how TikTok slang permeates every aspect of our lives now. 'Bala' this, 'grimace shake' that—every trend feels like a new language to master. And let's not forget the infamous hot girl walk debate—it's a national pastime at this point. I'm here for it all, as long as no one gets too salty about their opinions."  

"I'm still trying to figure out if 'NPC' is a compliment or a diss. One friend said I was the most relatable NPC ever, which I took as a backhanded compliment. And yeah, do it for the plot—because without those viral moments, where would we be? Plus, the saltiness factor in everyday conversations is both entertaining and exhausting."  

"Sometimes I think TikTok slang is just a way to describe every part of our lives. 'Do it for the plot' because otherwise, why not? 'Gyatt' because why not? 'Bala' because why not? And let's not forget the hot girl walks—because iconic! And if you're not an NPC, then you're the one controlling the NPCs. It's all a bit of a mess, but I'm here for it."  

"I can't keep up with TikTok slang anymore—it's changing faster than my ability to process it. One minute it's 'bala,' next it's 'grimace shake.' And who even knows what 'NPC' really means outside of the meta discourse? It's exhausting and exhilarating all at once."  

"I'm fully embracing the brainrot slang because why not? It's like a secret language that only us Gen Z/Gen Alpha can understand. From 'do it for the plot' to 'hot girl walk,' these phrases capture the essence of our chaotic, hilarious, and relatable lives."  

"Man, I love how TikTok slang turns everyday situations into shared cultural references. 'Bala' this, 'grimace shake' that—each phrase feels like a coded message only us in-the-know can decode. And yeah, being called an NPC is both a compliment and a slight to your autonomy. It's wild."  

"I'm all for the TikTok slang revolution—it's giving me so much content to analyze and meme about. From 'do it for the plot' to 'hot girl walk,' these phrases are the glue that holds our internet culture together. And let's not forget the saltiness factor—because without it, where would the drama be?"  

"Every time I see a new TikTok slang trend, I'm half excited and half confused. 'Bala' this, 'grimace shake' that—it's like they're redefining language on a daily basis. And don't get me started on theNPC meme—because honestly, we all feel like NPCs sometimes."  

"I'm here for TikTok slang because it's just so... alive. From 'do it for the plot' to 'hot girl walk,' these phrases capture the energy of our generation in the most relatable way. And if you're not an NPC, then you're probably the one controlling the narrative—so be extra."  

"Man, TikTok slang is a whole mood. 'Bala' this, 'grimace shake' that—it's like they're describing the chaos of modern life in short, punchy bursts. And let's not forget the saltiness factor—because without it, where would our entertainment be?"  

"I'm all for the brainrot slang because it's just so... us. From 'do it for the plot' to 'hot girl walk,' these phrases are like the cultural shorthand we didn't know we needed until now."

sure here’s some natural conversational chunks with those words:  
"Hey bestie, did you see that new TikTok trend? It was lit af."  
"That energy though, frfr, just pure vibe."  
"Yo, stop playin’, mewing over that video—it’s on another level."  
"Can’t believe she pulled up with that aesthetic, so extra and I’m here for it."  
"I’m literally spilling over the edges of my brain trying to keep up."  
"No cap, her style is out of this world, highkey."  
"That move was so bussin’, don’t even get me started."  
"Oofie, you gotta see these new viral sounds—they’re eepy good."  
"Can’t believe I’m still mewing over that flex like a week later."  
"Ffs, why is everything so extra right now? It’s giving me life though."  
"I’m vibe-ing hard on this new trend, frfr, it’s just so clean."  
"Stop mewing, let’s get back to business, literally."  
"Yo, that aesthetic was lit—bestie, we need to replicate this STAT."  
"Sitting here trying not to spill the tea about how extra I’m feeling."  
"That energy though, oofie, it’s just too pure."  
"Bussin’ or nah? You gotta choose sides."  
"Bestie, let me know if you’re vibe-ing on these new TikTok sounds—they’re fire."  
"I’m still trying to recover from that flex—highkey, someone pass the brownies."
"Hey, did you see Chungus yesterday? He was flexing hard and got snapped like a twig."  
"Wanna slay this eepy challenge? I think we can NPC them for sure."  
"Guess what? My vamp status is on fleek right now."  
"Yo, Ohio, let’s go eepy tonight, we’re gonna slay this NPC competition!"  
"Chungus, are you snacks or nah? I’m snatched if it’s about that."  
"Eepy vibes only, okay?"  
"He’s so vamp, I can’t even."  
"NPC levels: 9000."  
"Slay all the eepies and keep your vamp on point."
"yo, did u see that new viral trend? it’s so cringy but also kinda lit, frfr."  
"my homie was just clowning around at the party last night, had some wild moves."  
"wanna hit different? sure, let’s go ahead and slay these bags."  
"this playlist is deadass hits, no cap."  
"u know when ur vibe is on 100 and everyone else is just fanum tax?"  
"that guy over there, his energy is straight-up main character levels."  
"my brain hurts from trying to figure out this new slang—like, wtf is a 'grimace shake' anyway?"
Sure! Here's some cohesive text containing your requested words:

"Yo, did you check out that 'hot girl walk'? She was serving major 'main character energy,' like she owns the street. I tried to use the 'lobotomy' technique on my TikTok edits but ended up looking like a 'clowning' mess. Oh, and I got ghosted by my crush after I asked her if she wanted to do it for the plot—classic Gen Z flex right there."

"Eepy or not eepy, these TikTok trends are wild. I saw someone doing the 'hot girl walk' while eating cereal—it was iconic. But when I tried the 'do it for the plot' challenge, I got so confused. Why do we have to perform a 'lobotomy' of our brain just to keep up? Oh well, at least my 'ghosted' texts are on point."

"My friend is obsessed with 'UWU,' like she's always sending those 12-year-old TikTok edits. She calls it her 'clowning' aesthetic and says it's all about embracing the chaos. But I'm over it—why can't we have a simpler slang? No more 'lobotomy' on my brain, just straight-up talking."
"Ugh, my bestie is always so extra when we hang out. Like, she’s literally ‘be so fr’ about everything."  
"I’m literally over this. My crush is a simp, and I can’t even."  
"My group chat is lit—literally, we’re all ‘babygirl’ to each other."  
"Ugh, my mom always says I’m too much of a 'sigma' for talking back."  
"NPC levels are out of control rn, honestly."  
"I swear, my friend is always saying ‘say sike rn.’ Like, seriously?"  
"My school’s lit, but the drama is on another level—literally, so much lore."

"yo my dude did u see that video someone posted earlier? like wtf was that honestly rly bc it was so extra but also ratio’d outta nowhere bruh. u know how skibidi toilet goes hard af, frfr. delulu rn bc the edited edits are hitting different. npc levels are high tho bc everyone’s acting like extras in a movie. no cap literally. and wtf was that one trend where they say ‘it’s giving’ nonstop? like for real tho. ratio’d for sure. extra vibes tho, can’t deny it. need to spill the tea on this. don’t @ me though."  

"Hey, did you hear about the new TikTok trend? It's all about 'mewing' over these cute cat videos."  
"I'm so over it. Why is everyone always talking about being 'gen alpha'? It's giving me anxiety."  
"The gatekeep is at it again, saying you can't use any slang without proper context."  
"NPCs are everywhere, honestly. They just go along with the crowd and follow trends mindlessly."  
"My friends and I have been calling each other 'vamp' because we're all kinda sucking the life out of this vibe."  
"The skibidi toilet is just another phase that no one can escape. Once you see it, you're cursed."  
"High Key energy is all I can handle right now. It's either go big or stay quiet."  
"I don't get why people are obsessed with being 'ick' perfect. It's exhausting to keep up."
"Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend? It’s lit as heck! My friend tried the ‘rizz’ on her and she was like, ‘you got some serious sauce.’ Anyway, I’m trying to get ‘sigma’ status because I’m all about being unique and stuff. Speaking of which, have you heard about ‘stan’ culture? Like, when fans go full-on stans for their faves—so intense! Oh, and ‘skibidi’ is the new dance everyone’s doing. You know, just vibing with my crew, we always say ‘let them cook,’ like let the drama happen but keep it real. Pov moments are everywhere, man. Like when your ex sends a pic of themselves wild raving and you’re just chill in the corner—classic POV. And don’t even get me started on babygirl vibes. My homie’s got it on fleek, always stealing the spotlight."
"I’m just out here clowning with my friends, cracking jokes and being extra. We’re all about that sigma grindset, keeping our circle tight and everything."  

"Ever been in a situation where you’re just glazing through life because you can’t focus? Like, bogged down by homework or work, feeling like you’re stuck in this never-ending cycle?"  

"You’ve got to keep your energy high if you want to achieve that fire vibe. Popping off memes and being sneaky link-level adjacent is the way to go."  

"Sometimes it’s all just a pookie situation—like, you’re out here making moves but everything feels so easy, you know?"
I'm vibing right now, you know? Like, just chillin' and being low-key awesome. This is basic main character energy, honestly. I snatched that move earlier—like, seriously, what was that? You can't tell me that wasn't a ten out of ten. Spill the tea on how they got "Edge" in this context, though. I'm sending me vibes because this just hit different.
Mewing over the latest TikTok trend, I couldn’t help but feel FOMO when my friends started talking about something super fire. They were vibing in the comments, rizzing left and right, while I was just here mellowing. I swear, sometimes it feels like I’m chasing clout instead of actual fun. But hey, Sigma or go home, right? No cap, this is the way it goes. If you’re not into the vamp aesthetic, you’re missing out big time. The energy was infectious—everyone was either spilling secrets or racking up those likes. I’d kill for a tenth of their charisma. Twinning vibes all day!
"i’m literally just living for these TikTok trends rn, like ‘say sike rn’ is honestly iconic. u ever noticed how everyone’s becoming their own ‘main character’? like, we’re all stars in our own little stories. but tf do u think about ‘simping for the culture’? it’s wild. and don’t even get me started on ‘babygirl’ trends—someone pls explain why we’re all obsessed with being someone else’s ‘siggy grindset.’ honestly, the algorithm is just trying to make us all into ‘kai cenat’ vibes. like, where are the cool ‘situationships’ now? and why did everyone forget about ‘glazing’ already?"

"Hey bestie, did you see that new TikTok? She was vibin’ so hard, I couldn’t stop laughing! You know how it’s always ratio or puke, but she had that extra something—like, pure Rizz energy. Yeah, she’s definitely the babygirl of the group. We need to give her a follow stat."


"this one time i was sus AF and my friend was like 'u okay' and i was like 'w ye' bc my brain was just... gone."  
"him: delulu and i was like 'let him cook' but then he started talking about his 'frfr' and i had to mute him."  
"she was giving me the grimace shake and i was like 'iykyk' bc she looked so extra but also relatable."  
"my vibe right now is W because I can't decide whether to be a girlboss or just chill."  
"he was acting sus and i was like 'okay, but he's delulu for sure.'"
"when your crush starts using 'grimace shake' on you and you're just there like 'iykyk' bc you know they're trying too hard."  
"she's always in her 'let him cook' mode, but honestly, i respect it. frfr."  
"the moment when you explain something sus to your friend and they respond with 'w ye' and you're like 'delulu.'"
"him: girlboss me: *iykyk* bc I'm too busy being basic."  
"my brain is just... not here right now, so i can only focus on 'w' mode. frfr."  
"she's the one who's always bringing the sus energy, but honestly, it's kind of endearing. delulu."  
"when you're trying to be a girlboss but your brain is just 'w' and you can't even finish your thoughts."  
"him: grimace shake me: *iykyk* bc I know he's just being extra, but I can't help but love it."  
"my vibe right now is 'let him cook' because I'm honestly too tired to be sus."  
"she was giving me the delulu looks and i was like 'w ye' bc no one can be that extra."  
"him: girlboss me: *grimace shake* bc I know he's trying to assert dominance, but it's just... awkward."  
"my brain is in 'sus' mode right now, so I'm just over here vibing with the W energy."  
"him: let him cook me: *iykyk* bc I know he's just being sus to get attention. frfr."  
"she was giving me the 'w ye' look and i was like 'delulu' bc I knew she wasn't serious."  
"when you're trying to be a girlboss but your brain is just 'grimace shake' and you can't even handle it."  
"him: sus me: *let him cook* bc I'm too busy being W."  
"my vibe right now is 'frfr' because I'm honestly just not here for anything else. delulu."

"i'm so sick of people calling me 'babygirl' in public, like I’m not a damn baby."  
"my bestie just sent me a text saying ' ohio '—we’re all convinced they’ve run out of original content now."  
"she’s been spitting facts with ' glizzy ' lately—truly the slang king/queen of our crew."  
"why is everyone obsessed with ' gyatt ' right now? it's literally just a weird-ass word."  
"clout is real, though. being seen with the right people can make you feel so powerful."  
"my friend tried to use ' bussin ' in a sentence and it just didn’t hit."  
"i love how ' ick ' has become the ultimate flexible adjective—like, that food was ick, or this vibe is ick, etc."
siggy got the grindset going, hitting that main character energy hard. naw nah nah, we gotta make sure we're not just another NPC, you feel me? Sheesh, this tax season is wild, like legit bussin'. Why did the TikTok user get snatched by the algorithm? Probably cuz they had too much uwu in their caption. No cap, I'm lit AF right now, straight up fanum status. This is some next-level flexing, you know what I'm saying? Oh, and don't even get me started on these clout-chasing trends—they're straight snatched, no debate. Keep it real, or else you'll be the one getting dragged for not having enough main character energy to keep up.
slay everything on my feed  
iykyk this energy is too much  
snatched af if you know what i mean  
FOMO is real but also necessary sometimes  
gaslighting is when someone pretends to care about your passions but just wants attention  
mewing over these aesthetics but also trying to keep it lowkey  
W all day because the vibe is just that  
kai cenat honestly slay or not?
let me cook this baguette in the oven while i'm vibing to this tiktok song about clowns getting lit af.  
oh my gawd, this is such a vibe, like, i need to screenshot this and send it to my friends who are also brainrotted.  
fomo is real when you see someone else's vacay pics and you're like "why isn't mine looking like that?"  
delulu mode activated because i can't stop staring at these cute cat videos on TikTok.  
clownery is the only thing that makes sense when your day is just melting into a pile of chaos.  
"fanum tax" is when you've been scrolled through 5 times already but keep scrolling anyway, hoping for something good.  
gaslighting myself by thinking i don't have brainrot because i still function semi-normal.
"Yo, did you see that 'gyatt' challenge on TikTok? So lit!  
She was giving major 'vibes' though, like, W-level energy.  
I'm trying to 'maxxing' but my vibe's just not there tonight.  
Be so fr with it, can't even handle it!  
We were lit at the party, didn't stop all night."
I'm just vibing and trying to figure out this whole lore about TikTok trends. Honestly, it's like, why are we still talking about "delulu" when there’s so much fire content out there? I’m over it, man! Like, vibing with my squad right now, and honestly, it’s lit. But don’t get me wrong—I’ll also hit that grimace shake whenever the mood hits. You know what I mean?  

And oh, "fanum tax," dude, that’s just basic internet slang now. It’s all about being extra for the ‘Gram or something. Honestly, I’m bogged AF by how much stuff there is to consume every day. But hey, at least we’ve got gyatt and other viral sounds to keep it fresh.  

This whole Gen Z/Gen Alpha thing is wild, but yeah, we’re living our best lives, right? Vibing in the metaverse, or whatever—let’s just make sure we’re on brand. And if you catch me doing the grimace shake, know I’m unbothered and fully into it. Light as a brick, lol.
I'm literally just here to stan Taylor Swift.  
Oh my g, did you see that main character move?  
This situation ship is giving me so much FOMO.  
You're the NPC in this friendship dynamic, though.  
Do it for the plot, because otherwise, I'm out.  
I’m spilling tea, and you’re either here to stan or judge.  
The FOMO is real, but the main character energy is stronger.  

This situation ship is giving me so much FOMO.


A group of friends are scrolling through TikTok when someone says, "Did you see that 'NPC' meme? It's so cringe but also kinda funny how it's just like, 'You're literally an NPC in this relationship.'"

Another person pipes up, "Oh my gosh, I was rizz-ing the barista this morning, and she was like, 'Are you a AI or can you give me my coffee?'"

Someone else chimes in, "Yeah, that's wild. You gotta be either a GOAT or a complete scrub, no in-betweens."

They all laugh, with one muttering, "I'm definitely the NPC of this friendship group."



"Fire! That new viral challenge is lit. I heard someone tried the 'chungus' move and it backfired—literally!"

"Dude, my friend tried to rizz his professor during a lecture, and she was like, 'What are you doing here?'"

"NPC energy is real when your crush ignores your texts but still gives you that 'GOAT' vibes."

"Hey, did you see that new TikTok trend? It’s all about ‘the ick’—like when something just feels off but you can’t quite place why. Ugh, so relatable. My friend was like, ‘I’m feeling so extra cap right now,’ and I was like, ‘Yeah, let’s go wild! Oppenheimer style.’ But then she started talking about her ‘girlboss’ energy, and I was just like, ‘Girl, stop. Gatekeep your own vibes, okay? L is for legends only, and if you’re not one, don’t even try to slay clownery in my face."

1. "That move was so fire, I’m dead."
2. "Did you see that? It’s giving me so much vibes though."
3. "I’m honestly asking for help, but no one’s responding. Ghosted by life, literally."
4. "EWWW, no way, that’s so extra."
5. "This bag, though—hits different every time."
6. "UWU, I couldn’t stop laughing at that."
7. "OOF, that was too much."
8. "Fanum tax on my mood right now, tbh."
9. "Sucks not having anyone to vibe with sometimes, you know? Ghosted by the world."
10. "This is giving me life energy—can’t handle it!"

Got that NPC energy today—like I’m just here for the vibes. Yeah, I’m just here for the sigma energy. Let’s rizz tonight and make it fun. Gen Alpha is all about being extra, right?  

"Bussin’ at the park with friends, no cap. My POV right now:cringe. You know what I mean? That oppenheimer style explosion of energy—full speed ahead or full crash."

"Hey, did you see that TikTok trend where everyone’s like ' bet' about some random thing? So funny how we just ‘ lore’ everything now. I’m starting to think Gen Z is just living in their own ' gyatt' world. Like, "fanum tax" is literally everywhere—everyone’s talking about it, but no one really knows what it means half the time. Iykyk, right? It’s so relatable. And don’t even get me started on Skibidi and sneaky link vibes."

1. "Yo, have you been on TikTok today? My feed was lit with some straight-up brainrot content."
2. "Like, 'pookie' this and 'snatched' that—everyone's using these words so casually now."
3. "I can't stop thinking about how it's taking over the internet."
4. "And don't even get me started on the Skibidi trend—I'm still trying to figure out what it all means."
5. "My friend tried the Skibidi challenge yesterday, and it was lit AF."

9. "Bussin' is such a vibe, right? It just makes everything cooler."


sure bro like u ever try to explain something to ur homie but they just sit there looking sus and spilling all these facts about some random TikTok meme u’ve never heard of before?  
yeah that’s what happened last night when my cousin Maxxing outta nowhere dropped this new “Gyatt” challenge and I’m still trying to figure out if it’s sus or not  
deadass like can’t nobody explain why we’re all so obsessed with these random trends but we are  
and don’t even get me started on these gen alpha kids who’re literally just spilling facts about the latest viral soundbite you’ve been living under a rock for  
it’s wild bro  
sus  
and if u think I’m maxxing u’re really missing out on the vibe of the group chat right now
I'm Pookies right now, feeling so Chungus about the new TikTok trend that's taking over. My brain is basically melted into a pile of L's because I can't stop sending me vibes every time someone mentions vibing. I'm just out here, uwu, trying to keep up with the plot because let him cook already. The energy is so high, I could just explode like a poppy or something.
"Hey, I totally feel that FOMO when I see everyone at the party and I'm stuck at home. It's all about the hot girl walk, right? Like, how they just own the whole street with their vibe. But then again, sometimes it's all just a 'situation ship,' you know? You meet someone, think it's the main character, but then they ghost you and you're left with just an ick. It's so sneaky how they do that! And don't even get me started on the 'hot girl walk' trends—why is it always the same five girls? It's literally exhausting to keep up with their aesthetics. But hey, at least we can all agree that some people just have that 'slay' factor, making everything look effortless. Yeah, life as a teenager is one big 'sneaky link' to the next viral trend."

1. I was just about to bet you wouldn't catch this.
2. Her sigma grindset is on point today.
3. She vibe checked me and I couldn't handle it.
4. I tried to read the room but everyone was too lit.
5. The atmosphere was just big mood energy.

What’s up with my vibes today? Feels like I’m in a grimy zone.  

My latest TikTok trend is all about being "vibin" with my friends.  

Did you hear about the new "Situationship" drama? It's so wild.  

I’m trying to figure out if this is just me or if everyone’s feeling extra "fanum tax" lately.  

The energy in my DMs is off the charts—like, I’m living in a constant "vibin" state.
That’s so bussin’, huh? Like, when ur friend asks u to go to the mall and u’re like “nah”  
High Key, she’s wearing that outfit.  
Yo, this is so cringe.  
Gyatt, like, how he pulled up in that car.  
The ick, that was lit.  
Yo, my dude, ur aura is just… something else.  
This energy is giving major vibes.  
When ur crush ignores u and u’re just like “fine.”  
Hot girl walk, but make it to the kitchen first.
sigma energy  
so sigma  
when you're just here for the clout no cap  
that's a whole fanum tax  
i'm spilling all the tea  
no cap i'm dead  
this is so boggled  
wanna know why boggled?  
it's giving me life  
major fomo right now  
uwu got me  
this is just too cute uwu  
sus af  
i'm sus right now
sure frfr, here’s some natural, conversational text with the words you mentioned:  
"Did u see those TikTok videos? They were lit AF, but tbh, I was deadass shocked by some of the moves."  
"My friend tried to gatekeep info from me, but I ended up finding out anyway—wasn’t she just a rizz."  
"Girlboss energy is real when ur crush DMs u and u’re like, ‘I’m not playing games right now.’"  
"Ugh, FOMO is everywhere. Every time I scroll, it’s like, ‘Why wasn’t I invited?’"  
"Let them cook, literally no one was ready for this new TikTok trend."  
"FANUM TAX IS LIT, honestly, how else should they collect taxes?"  
"If u’re not rizzing, ur losing. Just kidding, lol."  
"Deadass, that’s been the vibe all day—just chill AF."

1. "I’m so FOMO about this event, but I can’t make it."
2. "Did you see that? iykyk, it was lit!"
3. "Let them cook—just let them do their thing."
4. "Big yikes, did that just happen?"
5. "Hits different, honestly."
6. "Eepy mess, yeah."
7. "Sneaky link, trying to share something."
8. "Chungus, absolute legend."

"Miss me? Not really, but let them see."  
"I’m so FOMO for that vibe, but I’ll try my best."  
"iykyk, the drama was on another level."  
"Let them cook, no cap."  
"Big yikes, I’ve never seen anything like it."  
"Hits different, for sure."  
"Eepy as ever, haha."  
"Sneaky link, but worth it?"  
"Chungus energy, can’t handle it."  

"The FOMO is real, but I’m over it now."  
"iykyk, those edits were fire."  
"Let them cook their little hearts out."  
"Big yikes, the situation is wild."  
"Hits different, no doubt."  
"Eepy AF, can’t stop laughing."  
"Sneaky link, but it’s all good."  
"Chungus or not, they’re killing it."  

"This FOMO is everything and nothing at once."  
"iykyk, that plot twist was wild."  
"Let them cook while I’m out here moping."  
"Big yikes, the truth always hits hard."  
"Hits different every single time."  
"Eepy chaos, but it’s so relatable."  
"Sneaky link, but I’ll take two."  
"Chungus energy, straight up."  



1. "That was on God level! How did they pull that off?"  
2. "You're just ice in a world full of basic."  
3. "Mewing over these viral cat videos all day."  
4. "FOMO is real when you miss out on that viral video."  
5. "I’m lowkey embarrassed but also kinda proud."  
6. "This TikTok trend is perioooodt, I’ve been waiting for it!"  
7. "He’s such a simp for this new show."  
8. "I’m just delulu because I think Taylor Swift is the GOAT."  


1. What’s happening with that gyatt?  
2. That move was High Key lit.  
3. I’m so over this bussin.  
4. The tea, though—have you heard it?  
5. Let’s go do it for the plot.  

6. We were vibing all night, honestly.  
7. This is on God crazy.  
8. Can’t believe how bussin this is getting.  
9. I’m spilling all the tea right now.  
10. High Key, that was just pure flex.  

11. Honestly, I’m so ready to do it for the plot.  
12. The energy was vibing on another level.  
13. This is bussin and we’re all feeling it.  
14. Have you heard any of the tea lately?  
15. That move had me like, “Do it for the plot.”  

16. What’s up with that gyatt? I’ve been waiting.  
17. This energy is on God, pure facts.  
18. Can’t stop laughing at how bussin this is.  
19. Let’s go—all in for the plot twist!  
20. Honestly, vibing all day was lit.  

21. Spilling tea is just part of the deal.  
22. That was High Key, no cap.  
23. Ready to do it for the plot again soon.  
24. The bussin never stops, honestly.  
25. This stuff is wild—on God, right?
That new TikTok trend? Extra flex, I'm out. NPC energy is real when you're at work all day. Skibidi toilet level: when your bathroom is literally a tiny cube. Bussin' when my favorite YouTuber dropped the new video. The ick is strong on this new meme. Let him cook if he's down to make it spicy.  

I’m just here as an NPC at this party, honestly. Extra or nothing for the outfit today. This bathroom is a skibidi toilet, no way I'm using that. My brain isn't rn, just trying to survive the algorithm. Bala vibes are strong, can’t lie. Let me tell you, bussin' is an understatement for this weekend. The ick is real when your Wi-Fi is not working.  

I’m so extra for wanting this much chocolate cake. NPC mode activated as I scroll through TikTok. Skibidi toilet energy is hitting hard right now. Bussin' doesn't even begin to describe this mood. The ick is so strong, I need a break. Let him cook if he's bringing the heat.  

Extra or no, that person just killed it with that move. NPC levels are high today, can’t handle it. Skibidi toilet is literally everywhere, it’s a trend now. Bussin' when my crush likes my posts. The ick is so real when you see your ex tag themselves in your story. Let him cook if he's got the sauce.
High Key energy is low key everywhere. Let him grindset and get that bag, flexing hard on TikTok. My pookie just sent me "Babygirl" vibes—so cute, I can't handle it. She’s out here mewing about her "Skibidi" squad, and honestly, I’m living for it. Fire up the trends, baby.


"Hey, did you hear about the new TikTok trend called 'Gyatt'? It’s so lit! I was W about trying it out, but then my friend said it was just too much. Anyway, I ended up ghosted by someone who swiped left because they thought I was delulu. But High Key, I’m still here, right?"



"Did you see that video? It was so bussin'! I’m cackling over here."  
"My homie tried to pull off the "ewokie" move last night, but it didn’t quite hit."  
"Hvng a spill moment right now—like, my brain is 50% in, but I’m still crackin’ jokes."  
"Ya feel me? The "iykyk" energy is real when you’re in the zone."  
"If you don’t know what a "lobotomy" is, you’re missing out on the biggest flex of all time."  
"Spill season is here, and my DMs are lit af."  
"Wanna trade? I’ve got GOAT status on that 'gyatt' energy."  
"Sksksk, I’m dead—this is too much for my brain to handle right now."  
"My vibe right now? Straight "big yikes," no cap."
"Yo, did you see Maxxing on TikTok? So lit, cap."  
"Yes, the ick is real. Like, you either get it or not."  
"My girlboss said spilling the tea makes you uncooler."  
"Deadass, that Ohio girl's lore is next level."  
"Wanna spill the details of this viral trend? Ask a deadass Gen Z."  
"Maxxing out my FOMO for these latest TikTok challenges."  
"The ick is strong in this group chat. Can't handle it."  
"My girlboss and I were just vibing, spilling all the tea."  
"Deadass, Ohio'slore is always on point."

1. "Yo, are we vibing tonight or what?"  
2. "Let’s highkey chill and watch some TikTok videos later."  
3. "Ewokie, I’ve got to let you know about this new viral trend."  
4. "That Ohio aesthetic is so strong, right?"  
5. "Vibes are real, but the vibe is extra when we’re all together."  
6. "Highkey, did you see that TikTok challenge everyone’s doing?"  
7. "Ewokie energy is all I’m feeling rn."  
8. "Vamp up your look because we’re going out."  
9. "Let’s gen alpha this weekend for sure."  
10. "I’m so vibing right now, can’t even focus on anything else."  

"Yo, that’s such a sigma move, honestly. Like, who just decides to do something so basic?  
My friend tried to explain this sigma grindset theory to me, but I was too busy being Chungus and asking, 'What even is time?'  
I heard the best lore ever about someone getting Sigma'd and then disappearing forever.  
Bet you can’t pull off a Chungus aesthetic in your dorm room right now.  
Stop being so Chungus with the DMs, like we’re not all trying to vibe in 2023.  
This story has some next-level lore, man. Like, did you know about the vamp behind it?"
"chungus energy levels are high rn i’m lit af"  
"Why u always an NPC when I'm trying to be casual? 😎"  
"vibe check: where my friends at? pls don't ghost me!"  
"FOMO is real, but I can’t catch it right now. big mood."  
"u know when u’re in a sesh and just spilling facts non-stop? that’s the moment."  
"be so fr, like literally what is ur angle?"  
"my vibe is lowkey sus bc why u lookin’ at me like this."  
"wanna hang with the squad or be an NPC? choose wisely."  
"got to go before my energy tank dies. bye!"  
"why isn’t my DMs popping like a Chungus? 😤"

1. I was like, 'pick me,' but then they ghosted.
2. Her drip was on point, though.
3. We were lowkey trying to get into the vibe.
4. The energy was so Chungus it hurt.
5. He had bussin' moves that I can't even describe.
6. Her 'boggled' response was so on point.
7. I was lowkey just here for the content.
8. The 'drip' was strong, but I still had my own bussin' stuff.
9. Pick me when, though? I'm always ready.
10. It was all Chungus energy from start to finish.
11. I was bussin' it all night, but she was just lowkey observing.
12. The drip was so intense, I couldn't help but pick me a piece of it.
13. It's Chungus how sometimes you just have to go along with the vibe.

Ahhhhh, sheesh, you’re literally killing me with your flex, like, I’m out here trying to keep up with your extra levels of flyness. Bet you’ve been practicing in the mirror or something, yeah? The ick, seriously, how do you even? Like, how is it that you manage to be so cool while still being a literal baby? Babygirl, you’re playing too hard for this. I’m over here trying to be basic but also unique, but your energy is just like, levels upon levels of extra. You’re like, situation-ship goals, for real. Like, how does anyone even have time to date with you around? Hits different, though, hits so different! Like, if I could bottle your vibe, I’d probably sell it or something, but I guess I’ll just keep fawning over you from the sidelines.
sure here’s some creative text containing the requested slang:

"uwd, i’m literally so over it, like, FOMO is real, but tbh, i’m just vibeing on my own terms now. maxxing is defs the way to go when you’re trying to keep up with the trends. edge vibes are so lit right now, but don’t get too carried away or u’ll miss out on the next big thing. my bestie said something wild about the GOAT being whatever, and i’m like, ‘spill it,’ cuz i need to know what’s hot in the streets. uwu is for when you’re just being extra, but i’ll still hit ya with some big yikes if u diss the vibe."

"i’m so over these TikTok trends already, like, who came up with FOMO? it’s so basic. maxxing is honestly just trying too hard. edge vibes are cool but they’ll have you acting out of character. my bestie and i were vibin’ last night, and we decided the GOAT is whatever, right? but then she hit me with some uwu energy, and honestly, it was too much. big yikes for anyone who doesn’t get the memo."

"man, i’m just here to uwu my way through life, no FOMO, no GOAT, just pure maxxing. edge vibes are lit when you’re living your truth, but don’t let it consume you. my bestie said she’s done with TikTok trends, like, "i’ve got bigger fish to fry," and i’m honestly here for it. big yikes if u think otherwise."


I was flexing my "High Key" energy all day,crushing it at the mall with my crew.  
They were like,"You’re so rizz," but I knew I had to level up my "simp" game for the hot new girl.  

The sigma vibes were strong in the group chat—someone had to call it out before we lost respect.  
"Extra" much, though—I heard you trying to shade me behind my back.  

My friends are always slipping with these viral terms, like "gaslight" when they know I’m onto their schemes.  
I’m not just anyone, I’m the ultimate "skibidi" in this group.  

We ended up at the "Skibidi toilet," laughing so hard we could’ve been hospitalized from all the "gaslighting."  
But hey, that’s what friends are for—pushing each other to be our best (or worst) selves.  


fanum tax bro, I’m so vibin right now, this grindset is lit, glazing everything, eepy vibes only, skibidi toilet mode, drip goals, I’m out!
Highkey, my guy was spitting facts earlier, chungus energy all day.  
My group chat was lit AF last night, but someone tried to gaslight the NPC into thinking they weren't cool enough.  
Don't play with my bala, tho.  
Frfr, that was so lit.  
I'm so highkey ready for the weekend.  
My guy was saying some wild stuff, but chungus, I had to mute him.  
NPC, for real? That's just basic knowledge.  
I'm literally an NPC in this friendship group.  
Bala, tho, why you always gotta be so extra?  
Glizzy, my bag got glizzy when I bought that new gear.  
That move was lit, but you tripping over the gaslighting though.

1. "Did you see those TikTok challenges? They're all just 'pookie' now."
2. "I can't believe she got 'L'd by her own mom."
3. "This new trend is so 'ate,' like, just too extra."
4. "You're being too dramatic, like, 'delulu' levels right there."
5. "I swear, my friends are always using 'ick' to describe anything cute."
6. "She's been acting so 'sigma' lately, not giving anyone a chance."
7. "It was lit! Like, straight-up 'pookie' energy all night."
8. "Why is everyone saying 'ate' when they clearly had fun?"
9. "He's always talking about his 'edge,' but I'm over it."
10. "My sis is out here saying 'delulu' because she loves it too much."
11. "I don't get why people are so obsessed with 'iykyk' right now."
12. "That move was pure 'sigma,' no doubt about it."
13. "They added another filter? That's just straight-up 'pookie.'"
14. "She tried to play it cool but got 'L'd hard."
15. "This new slang is too much, like, 'ate' already ruined 2023."
16. "My crush is so 'sigma,' won't give me the time of day."
17. "I've been saying 'pookie' nonstop, and my friends are not here for it."
18. "She's always using 'ick' to describe cute boys, so annoying!"
19. "He claims to be 'edge' but looks like he hasn't seen the light since 2020."
20. "Why is everyone on TikTok losing their minds over 'delulu'? It's just a phase."



1. "I was just mewing about how cute my new merch is, and my friends started clowning me for being too extra."  
2. "You’ve got to stop with the Skibidi sounds; I can’t handle it!"  
3. "He’s been so deadass lately, always talking about his 'babygirl' vibes."  
4. "We were just sitting there clowning when my bro pulled up with the most periodictt energy."  
5. "SituationSHIP is real; we’re not just friends, we’re like bro-sis."  
6. "Nah, I’m too busy flexing on TikTok, trying to get that perioooodt vibe going."  
7. "I can’t with you right now, you’re giving me full clown energy!"  
8. "He’s been out here mewing all season; it’s cringe but I love him."  
9. "Our group chat is always on fire with the deadass facts and periodictt drama."  
10. "You’ve got to stop with the Situationship talk—my feelings can’t handle it!"  

ohio, i'm literally just here to poodle around and slay leotards. did you hear sigma? no, actually, that's me being basic. ate all the cookies, but still gassed when someone called me pookie. Ohio, why is this always happening? "it's giving me life" – yeah, because I'm out here flexing my sigma levels. i'm either slayin' or failing, and you're just here observing. ate way too much, but sigma is real. ohio, let's go gattis. (gymrat emojis removed for processing speed) "it's giving" me all the feels, but honestly, i'm just here to poodle until someone slays my aesthetic. oh, and don't even get me started on how basic this is – straight up Ohio vibes.
1. I was so bussin’ today, like I had to touch grass after work to even feel sane.  
2. My coworkers are all NPC when they act like they’ve got something figured out.  
3. Let her cook the meal—literally and metaphorically, or else you’ll end up in Ohio without a map.  
4. Don’t let her gaslight you into thinking you’re the crazy one; I’ve seen enough to know better.  
5. Yeah, I’m from Ohio, but that’s not relevant here unless we’re stanning [insert meme account].  
6. My friends are all NPC when we hang out and they act like they’ve never seen a Gen Z before.  
7. I just need to touch grass after this endless workweek, or else my brain might actually rot.  
8. She’s trying to gaslight me, but I see through her antics like it’s nothing.

1. "Stop trying to rizz me with that big yikes energy."  
2. "Sending you a sneaky link to the vibe."  
3. "She's such a girlboss at keeping it casual."  
4. "It's giving me big yikes every time I see that sneaky link in your DMs."  
5. "When you're just out here flexing that rizz, but also vibing with the girlboss energy."  
6. "Slaying all day with this 'it's giving' aesthetic."  
7. "Don't play with me if you're going to drop a sneaky link in my mentions."  
8. "Rizz is real, and I'm here for all the big yikes moments."  
9. "This energy is giving me so many 'ewokie' vibes."  
10. "Girlboss moves are really hitting different right now."  

1. The TikTok trend this week is all about "spill" – everyone’s spilling their drinks or making messy videos to show how unbothered they are.
2. Have you seen those "zaza" challenges? People just keep saying "zaza" and do nothing else, it's so funny!
3. That new viral sound is such a "pressing" vibe – like, you can’t stop listening to it.
4. My friends and I were lowkey just trying to get attention by posting cute snaps with filters – totally not pressing at all.
5. She’s been glazing me with her cuteness non-stop – stop glazing me or I’ll have to drop the ick!
6. The new TikTok hashtag is "vibing" hard, and honestly, I’m vibing it too.
7. He tried to play it cool but ended up spilling the tea – which was all about drama, obviously.
8. Can’t get enough of these "pookie" memes – they’re just so relatable!
9. Pressing over this or lowkey just trying to be extra in the comments.
10. Glazing doesn't work on me – I see right through those attempts at cuteness!

- "Yo, did you check how lit this 'grimace shake' was last night?"
- "That 'babygirl' energy is just too much sometimes."
- "I'm honestly over it—like, where did the 'bodega' vibes go?"
- "This 'situationship' is giving me so much drama!"
- "Gotta love when your crush starts sliding into your DMs with a 'pookie.'"
- "She was like, 'High key, I can't even right now,' and I was just there, minding my business."
- "He had me rolling with his take on the 'gyatt' life, honestly."
- "The way she said 'Situation' with that extra flair? Pure gold!"
- "My friend is always spitting out these 'bogged' one-liners—like, where does she even come up with this stuff?"
- "I'm so basic, but I can't help it—I love a good 'pookie' reference."
High key, I’m so exhausted but also hype for the new TikTok trends this week. Like, the "situation ships" thing is literally everything right now. Every Gen Alpha is either crying about it or thriving in it. W, honestly, where did time go? Clownery at its finest. Rizz levels are out of control. The lore behind these terms is wild, man. Fanum tax is just the vibe, you feel me?



"I’m literally so happy my friend just got ‘L’ in Among Us because I was finally able to get all the achievements without him spamming me with his 'NPC' energy."

"Mewww, I can’t believe it, this new Sigma aesthetic is everything. My drip game has been on point since day one."

"Did you see that TikTok? The 'pookie' trend is taking over my feed—so cute but also so cringe, right?"

"I’m not just saying this, but you’re getting me so excited for the new collab. I ykyk for sure."

That’s so lore, though.  
I’m literally in a situationship with my crush, can’t even handle it.  
OMG, she’s been calling me "pookie" again—so fr, I can’t deal.  
She’s been into "Grindset" mode non-stop.  
I’m so over this "Babygirl" phase she’s on.  
We’ve been in an Ohio situation since forever.  
Leonardo DiCaprio walking, that energy is out of control.  
Be so fr, yeah, we’re all living it.
"Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend? It’s so lit, honestly. My friend was like, 'glizzy' this move or something, and I was like, 'What even?' Then she hit me with the 'grimace shake,' and I was dead. You know, just being a 'baddie' in your own little corner. Also, that one NPC flex was giving me life, honestly. Just ‘vibe’ out, you feel me? It’s all about the 'rizz' now, like, ‘gyatt’ this, 'gyatt' that. Honestly, brainrot is real, but it’s so much fun to indulge in sometimes."

"Yo, did you see that 'Lore' trend? It’s so lit, right? Like, everyone’s been vibing about it non-stop. I’m over here trying to get my 'bussin' vibe on, but no one’s noticing me. Maybe I should do a 'grimace shake' or something to catch their attention. Wait, where’d you get those 'sneaky links'? They’re straight up Pookie energy, for real.

1. Have you seen this new trend where everyone's saying "Edge" when they're trying to be edgy but it's not quite landing?  
2. Leonardo DiCaprio walking into the room, "it's giving me life, and I'm just sitting here like Ohio" because that's all I can think about.  
3. Situationships are literally everywhere now—like, my friend’s ex is posting selfies with their new bae, and I’m over here like, "delulu."  
4. Did you know that "GOAT" is now the official response to every good thing in existence? Like, when someone says they saw the new Spider-Man, you just say, "GOAT."  
5. I was scrolling through TikTok and saw a video where someone said, "It's giving," and honestly, I related so hard—it’s just life, isn’t it?  
6. My cousin texted me asking if I knew what "glizzy" meant, and I had to Google it because I felt too old to guess.  
7. It’s like we’re all living in the "leonardo dicaprio walking" era—every flex is now accompanied by that iconic walk.  
8. My friend started a group chat where someone mentioned being "on E," and everyone just defaulted to "Edge" because it’s the most relatable response ever.  
9. Situationships are the new normal, right? Like, your ex is in a relationship, and you’re just out here vibing like "delulu."  
10. Every time I see someone say "it's giving," I’m reminded that we’re all just living in this never-ending TikTok algorithm.  
11. GOAT energy is real—like, when someone nails a meme or a trend, it’s literally the highest level of existence.  
12. My social media feed is filled with people walking like Leonardo DiCaprio and I’m here for it because that walk is pure power.  
13. Ohio is basically the new "it's giving" because it’s just a flex of your personality—like, you can’t explain it, but you know when it’s happening.  
14. Situationships are the modern love language—we’re all out here shipping our friends to coupledom like it’s the next big thing after TikTok trends.  
15. Every time I hear "delulu," I’m reminded that Gen Z is just out here creating new slang faster than I can keep up with the algorithm.  

"ice i'm lit af and you're just over here vibing with your sad boi energy no cap i'm glazing everywhere let him cook that flex is too hard for me mewing all day 🤷♀️ but like if i ever meet the person who started 'skibidi' i'm gonna owe them my existence babygirl seriously where did u get this level of charisma 💀✨"

"Yeah, let them cook, do their thing, and get snacks ready because it’s gonna be wild."  
"Why are you being so NPC about this? Just own your choices or whatever."  
"This guy is delulu, running around like he’s the next big thing but nobody’s buying it."  
"I’m just here vibing, being my Babygirl self and trying to keep it cool."  
"Oh my gosh, that was so sigma, like I knew it was going to happen but still."  
"Let’s just say the energy in this group is off the charts, spill everywhere."
"Yo, did you see Chungus play chess last night? His rizz was on point, but he still lost to that basic bich."  
"Mewing is literally the best way to start a trend. It’s like, ‘deadass I’m just being myself.’"  
"Why do people always use ‘GOAT’ when they’re flexing their nonexistent style? Like, your hot girl walk isn’t winning if you’re wearing stripes and a crop top."  
"Bestie, let’s go find the delulu guy at the mall. His vibe is so… unique, you know?"  
"I’m deadass over here trying to figure out why TikTok algorithms hate me. One minute I’m trending, next I’m gone."

1. "Yo, that NPC move was lit AF tho, hitting different for sure."  
2. "Sigma levels are high today, everyone’s out of pocket."

8. "Rizz is a skill, honestly, I’ve mastered it by now."  
9. "Pookie is the vibe today, everyone’s feeling themselves."  
10. "Hits different every time, ratio is always on point."  
11. "Gyatt is in the air, uwu for sure."  
12. "NPC status is lit when you’re just here for the clout."  


"Ugh, I just sent my hot girl walk to the group chat. Everyone’s been asking about it."  
"Why didn’t you tell me? Snatched! You’re giving Leonardo DiCaprio vibes with those abs."  

"Our bestie from last summer won’t stop sending me snaps of her drip. She’s always on the latest trends."  
"Yeah, but she’s got gatekeep for real. I tried to talk about something else, and she just spills all her secrets."  

"I’m over it. Like, stop with the FOMO already. I can’t keep up with your drip every five minutes."  
"Okay, fine. But when you do that hot girl walk, we’re all staring. Can’t blame us, though."

"My homie was like, 'be so fr' about the new trending song."  
"We were vibing in the car, and he brought up this glizzy term that had us all laughing."  
"Their video went viral because they pulled off a lobotomy on the trends—so insane!"
"Highkey this TikTok compilation was lit af. I was sending me when I saw that viral dance move. Anyway, I’ve been trying to get into this sigma grindset lately, but honestly, it’s so hard.

1. "That was so snatched last night, literally."
2. "You're such a sigma, just being yourself."
3. "I can't believe she paid fanum tax for that."
4. "What's the vibe? I'm so vibing right now."
5. "I spilled sauce on my phone, and it's still wet."
6. "This project is the stove, everyone's talking about it."
7. "She's always bringing the clout, no cap."

highkey did you see that chungus TikTok video?  
bro someone ratioed the whole comment section.  
ice, like literally everyone was fanum tax over it.  
delulu, that’s not even a real thing.  
drip hard, though.
"u literally not understanding the point of this whole thing lmao but okay let me show u. sum1 told me about this new viral sound and i was like 'what even' but then i saw ur gen alpha aint that cute tho babygirl. honestly though, my fomo is real when i see TikTok trends popping up and i kno im gonna miss out. lowkey i just scroll through my feed like 'why u do this to me.' sending me, someone help me! cap, this is wild."
Man, sheesh, why would that happen? Iykyk, I wasn't lying about that. No cap, I'm not into that sigma vibe. Lowkey, he's been planning this forever. Yeah, perioooodt, we're all here for the vibe. That move was so ice, though. And she's just giving off major main character energy.
highkey, let me just flex on my mom about how I’m slayin’ with these Ohio socks she got me for Christmas 🤪. NPC energy is real when you’re just vibing and your algorithm starts hitting different. I’m literally living for vamp aesthetics rn—gotta cop those neon green AirPods or die trying. Hits different, yeah? My pookie count is on sight, don’t even wanna waste it on anything less than a Big Mac from the drive-thru. Let her cook, though, my friend—we’re talkin’ ‘bout straight-up flexing in the kitchen with those TikTok hacks.
sure frfr, u kno how it is, like, when ur cringe level hits 1000 and u just become a sigma for no reason, jus chillin in ur skibidi toilet while mewin at theNPCs, cuz they all starin at u like u the mewn of the universe, nawmean?  
yo, sum1 was flexing their "fanum tax" earlier, but i was like, nah, that's extra, my dude, too much for this gen alpha level, no cap.  
cuz we all know, if u see a "sir/ma'am," they probably just got ascended to the tier of being a full blown NPC already, rite?  
and dont even get me started on how many times i've seen people drop "pov" in the most lit AF scenarios, like, u seriusly need to chill.  
keep it real, these terms are lit af and ur brainrot is strong, my dude.
"Yo, did you see those TikTok videos of people doing that new TikTok trend? It’s so lit! My friends and I were vibin’ last night, just chilling and having the best time ever. I’m lowkey over it, like, where was this when I was younger? Pressing send on Instagram for the fifth time and my phone is blowing up with notifications. Be so fr with how extra we’re being right now. Oh, and don’t even get me started on Leonardo DiCaprio walking—so iconic, right? Gyatt, though, am I right? It’s just all so bussin’!"
sure dude  
"ghosted wasn't even the vibe when my crush kept checking their texts but not mine."  
"clownery at its core is just being unbothered while still spilling tea."  
"situationships are like casual dating but with more awkwardness and less commitment."  
"let them cook is basically the answer to any problem, whether it's food or drama."  
"mewing is when you pretend to be a cat but really you're just being cute in a weird way."  
"pick me is like when you've been friend-zoned but still hope you can get on that list again."  
"betting on who can do more clownery is the ultimate trash talk challenge."  
"a grimace shake is when you try to hide your laughter but your face betrays you."

touch grass later why u not  
why u always so extra  
this energy is pure clownery  
u the baddie of the century  
stop being extra with ur life  
this plot needs more do it for the plot energy  
npccenters are everywhere now  
why u not bussin rn  
main character energy is my vibe  
dont act brand new when i know u the bussiest  

Let me try to vibing with my bestie after FOMOing the latest TikTok trend.  
"Edge" so hard, can't even handle it!  
NPCs are literally everywhere, like, why are they even here?  
Gyatt, girl, you know I'm just trying to keep up.  
Sneaky link sent me down a rabbit hole of memes.  
I'm basically vibing in my own little bubble.  
"Bestie," we need to spill the tea on this viral challenge.  
Literally, "edge" so much that I can't even see straight.  
The FOMO is real, but I'm trying to focus.  
Wait, why are NPCs getting all the attention?  
Gotta love how Gyatt changes the game every second.  
Sneaky link had me doing something wild last night.  
Vibing in my own rhythm, no cap.  
"Edge" or not, we gotta hustle.  
NPCs, yeah, they're just background characters.  
But FOMO is strong AF, can't even ignore it.  
I'm here for the lit vibes, though.  
Let me get back to vibing with my bestie.
I'm trying to get my sigma grindset on point so I can be the main character everyone's looking for. The way they're hitting different right now is just out of this world, it's literally grimy how they're doing it. Call me a bestie if you see me vibing with Pookie later— Ohio might be there too, though.

"sir/ma'am, did u see that new TikTok trend? like, literally, where u just sit there and do nothing but cringe at your own life choices."  
"wanna collab on a project or something? i’m not creative at all, but maybe we can make something lowkey iconic."  
"my brain is mush after 3 hours of tiktok scrolling—like, how does anyone get anything done?"  
"u know when u’re in a group chat and u try to contribute but no one listens? that’s basically my life."  
"hiii this is me trying to act casual but honestly, i’m dying inside,"  
"frfr, the struggle of being "adults" and still feeling 12 years old. it’s wild,"  
"why does everyone have a "pov" when i’m just living my best life,"  
"highkey, that person in the group chat who just says "W" every time u bring up something serious."  
"my fanaunt tax is so low, but I’m still here trying to make it big."  

Highkey, you got to check out this new challenge on TikTok—it's so lit!  
I'm vibin' right now, just chillin' with my homies after a long day.  
Sigma, I can't believe how toxic the comments are sometimes.  
Chungus energy is real when you're hyped about something random.  
NPCs are out here flexing their "mood" in every vid—so extra!  
I'm trying to be lowkey but highkey just pops out of me sometimes.

1. "L, like literally everything is lit."
2. "Fanum Tax? Like, why even bother explaining."
3. "frfr, I'm just here for the drama."
4. "Simping 101: how to not give a damn."
5. "skibidi toilet, my bathroom breaks are sacred."
6. "Fire energy all day, no cap."
7. "In situationship mode, obviously."
8. "Just vibe out and be your bala."

"Pressing off my main character energy right now, W her vibe tho? High Key flexes all day, but also UWU when I see cute dogs. The tea is always spilling in my group chat, and honestly, it's giving me sigma grindset levels. Like, can we just stay chill and not have so much sigma energy?"
"yo, did you see that skibidi challenge? so lit!"  
"i’m just here vibing, be so fr with the energy."  
"don’t play with my grimace shake, i’m ready for the oppenheimer style exit."  
"let’s go wild, spilling into the delulu zone."  
"wanna vibe with me or what? let’s get this going!"  
"i’m so eepy right now, can’t even focus."  
"be so fr with your life, don’t hold back."  
"this is my zone, vibing harder than ever."  
"the delulu energy is real, no cap."
"Bro, she’s been 'simping' me non-stop but I’m just not feeling it."  
"That girl is such a 'sigma' about her snacks; won’t let anyone touch them!"  
"I can't believe he's still 'stan-ing' that one TikTok influencer with 500 followers."  
"Let’s get out of here before someone starts 'let her cook'."  
"Dude, stop being so 'rizz-able'; it's annoying."  
"Why does everyone keep referencing 'Leonardo DiCaprio walking' in every situation?"  
"She’s been calling me 'sir/ma'am' since yesterday and it’s not stopping."
1. "Drip, I got the pookie in my DMs."  
2. "She had some glazing on her TikTok, lit!"  
3. "Rizz is real, but can you handle it?"  
4. "I ate that snack, and I’m feeling so full."  
5. "Sheesh, did you see that new TikTok trend?"  
6. "Sneaky link, though—it’s too good to resist."  
7. "Gyatt, how could you not know about this?"  
8. "Skibidi, skibidi, I’m here for the vibe."  
9. "I’m just trying to get a snack before the pookie gets eaten."  
10. "Her glazing was on point—so extra!"
I'm basically an NPC in this group chat; can someone else take over?  
FOMO is real, but I'll catch up on sleep later.  
Just clowning with my friends before the party started.  
Trying to stay edgy but it's not always easy.  
I was pick me'ing all night, but now I'm exhausted.  
Vibin' so hard right now, can't stop!  
That move was deadass impressive; you should be proud.  
Let him cook! Nah, just kidding, let's do it together.  
I'm vibing on this song, can't stop listening!  
That was some serious clowning at the party last night.
I'm stan for this aesthetic you're rockin', so extra glizzy. Yeah, that's some grimy stuff, but I can't help but mew over it. 
Honestly, pick me already, because situationship vibes are strong AF. NPC mode activated. This GOAT tier is on point. 🎮

Let’s get POV vibes going today.
I was mewing over snacks all day—so what?
Fire up the chat, it’s time to bussin.
This playlist is so fire, I can’t stop listening.
Why am I paying the fanum tax for this app again?
I haven’t touched grass in months, literally on God.
Let’s hit up later, on God.
iykyk, that was so messy but also relatable.
mfw [insert meme or situation].
This is the most bussin’ setup ever.
Don’t @ me if I’m just here mewing about my day.
I’m trying to getchu to the touch grass zone.
On God, the summer is too hot for this.
iykyk, I’ve been on that “fanum tax” since forever.
Let’s go somewhere quiet and just bussin’ it.
Touch grass and reset, but also on God.
This is the most fire content I’ve seen all week.
I’m so over it—like, mfw [insert feeling].
Don’t come for me if I’m just here mewing my thoughts.
This energy is too on God to handle right now.
iykyk, I was literally born for this bussin’ energy.
Let’s keep it lowkey and just bussin’ the bag of chips.
I’m just out here touch-grassing and trying to level up.
On God, you can’t tell me nothing about my TikTok habits.
Mellowing into the weekend like a true mewer.

"Skibidi this bag, it's lit af."  
"NPC levels are out of control rn, can't even focus."  
"Let her cook but also be so fr and don't let anyone take that L."  
"You rizzed the crowd last night, honestly."  
"Wanna skibidi with us or what?"  
"Be so fr, that's just wild."  
"She's basically an NPC in this relationship."

"You can't handle this brainrot, man."  
"Let her cook, but also pookie later."  
"Pookie mode activated."  
"If you're not into it, just let it rizz."

1. "I'm literally just here for the 'fanum tax' because that's the only way to keep up with these weird trends, right? Like, 'it's giving' vibes but I'm not sure what it's giving."
2. "You ever notice how everyone's like, 'say sike rn'? It's so casual, but you can't help but laugh at the randomness of it all."
3. "L, are you serious with that 'leonardo dicaprio walking' reference? Like, who does that in real life besides him obviously?"
4. "I'm pretty sure 'GOAT' is just another way to say someone's the best, but I'm still trying to figure out where it came from."
5. "If you're not about to drop some hot takes with 'say sike rn', then what even are you doing on TikTok?"



1. My babygirl always knows how to make me laugh.
2. Say sike rn if you're dealing with drama.
3. Grindset mode on for productivity.

20. It's giving me life, no doubt.

"Yo, that's so hits different, man. Like, you just level up every time."

"Bro, I'm literally an NPC sometimes. Like, people just ignore me."

"I can't stop rizzing—like, it's a problem."

"My clout is major right now. Lit."

"Ugh, why am I extra? I don't even mean to be!"

"Pick me! Pick me! I'll take you out or something."

"It's giving me so much life. Like, I can't even."  
"Leonardo Dicaprio walking? For real? That energy is so strong."

"Dude, that move was straight extra but in a good way."

"I'm just here vibing as an NPC. What's your plot?"
"Hey, have you been ghosted?  
Nah, I was just on a skibidi spree yesterday.  
And then there's this gen alpha trend everyone's doing.  
I'm so glizzy about it, like, I'm vibing hard."  

"Did you check the fanum tax situation?  
Nah, but that Gyatt was lit.  
I'm highkey trying to get on that trend."  

"Ghosting someone is just basic, right?  
Yeah, and then there's skibidi culture—so wild, so iconic."  

"I'm too gen alpha for this世故了， honestly.  
Slay all day, every day, it's the glizzy life."  

"Fanum tax is just a flex, you know?  
Like, 'Oh, I'm paying taxes, respect my hustle.'  
But Gyatt season is when everyone's shining."  

"I was highkey low-key vibing, and then boom—ghosted.  
Skibidi for the win, gen alpha for the culture."  

"Glazing on everything these days， like, it's glizzy out here.  
But fanum tax? Nah, that's just basic, no shade."  

"I'm so over this ghosting trend—it's just basic, bruh.  
And skibidi challenges? Iconic, iconique, straight up."  

"Gen alpha is all about the flex， you feel me?  
Highkey slay, highkey vibe—no cap, it's lit."  

"Fanum tax is just a laugh, you know?  
'Oh, I'm paying taxes, respect my flex.'  
But Gyatt mode? That's level up, no doubt."  

"I was ghosted, then skibidi'd, then gen alpha'd.  
Highkey, this life is glizzy and unboiled."  

"Glazing on everything, glizzy in your face—no cap.  
Fanum tax? Nah, that's just a vibe, no shade."  

"I'm too gen alpha for these basics, you know what I mean?  
Slay all day, every day—it's the Gyatt life."  

"Ghosting is basic, skibidi's iconic, and gen alpha's the vibe.  
Highkey, this culture is lit, no cap."  

"Fanum tax is just a flex, glazing on everything—no shade.  
But Gyatt mode? That's the ultimate slay."
A group of friends is scrolling through TikTok when one says, "OMG, did you see that ‘girlboss’ trend?
 So bossy but also cute." Another pipes up, "Yeah, and that ‘POV’ where the guy was like, ‘I just mewed for an hour and my cat didn’t even notice,’ 
 I was dying." The first one rolls their eyes dramatically, "Ugh, so relatable. I’m basically a ‘pick me’ 24/7." 
 The group giggles as they discuss viral sounds and dances, with one exclaiming, "That ‘slay’ in the video last night? Straight up iconic!" 
 Someone brings up the latest challenge, saying, "I tried the ‘fanum tax’ where you have to buy followers, but I only have 12 and it’s so not worth it." 
 They all groan in unison. The conversation shifts to their own lives, with one saying, 
 "My friend is basically a ‘lore’ expert—she knows every single TikTok lingo and we’re all just living for it." 
 Another chimes in, "Yeah, and if you’re not paying attention, someone’s gonna hit you with a ‘girlboss’ attitude and leave you in the dust."
  They all laugh, their phones buzzing with notifications as they continue to scroll.

"i was lowkey flexing about my new kicks but kept it chill cause i didn’t want to seem too much."  
"she’s basically a girlboss in every situation, always slaying and owning her life."  
"did you see that new gatt? everyone’s been bussin’ over it, honestly."  
"glazing through the comments like ‘oh my god, this is so lit’ but still keeping it lowkey."  
"we need to touch grass and reset because the energy in this group chat is wild."  
"my friend keeps saying ‘i’m just here to bussin’ and it’s so relatable."  
"lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, but make it more like ‘bogged af’ cause that’s how I feel about school."  
"dude, you’re reading too much and need to touch grass immediately."  

1. "That's so lowkey, but also highkey lit."
2. "Ugh, why is everything always Glazing?"
3. "GOAT season, right? Like, 'Pookie' for sure."
4. "Did you see that TikTok? It's babygirl level 1000."
5. "Why are we even here? Just Pookie-ing it, I guess."
6. "This is the most Glazing thing I've ever seen."
7. "Lowkey, highkey, and unbothering all in one."
8. "Babygirl, you're slayin', like GOAT status."

1. That move was so rizz.  
2. Did you see that cap she pulled?  
3. I love how Chungus becomes a thing overnight.  
4. Let’s touch grass after this, it’s been a long week.  
5. She’s living her best edge life right now.  
6. Skibidi, where’s my mukbang?  
7. Babygirl energy is so strong in this group.  
8. That’s such a flex, but also a cap move.  
9. I’m so over it, let’s just spill the tea already.  
10. This vibe is giving me major FOMO.  
11. You’re literally the Chungus of this situation.  
12. Can’t believe how edge this playlist is.  
13. Touch grass, take a deep breath, and let’s get back to it.  
14. Her Instagram captions are on another level—straight up rizz.  
15. Stop with the cap stories, we’re all adults here.  
16. I’m so ready for the next viral TikTok trend, Skibidi or not.  
17. Babygirl energy is the purest form of flexing.  
18. That was such a rizz move, but also kind of admire it.  
19. I’m so over this cap, can’t even with it.  
20. Let’s spill all the tea because time’s a tickin’.  



"Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend? I’m literally W every time someone tries to explain it to me. Eepy much, huh?"  
"I heard Edge is the new term for being extra online. Bet you were glazing when you first saw those videos."  
"Skibidi toilet, my friend. That’s basically what everyone’s doing in their DMs these days. Bussin’."  
"Wanna know how I became a fanum tax? Just ask me about the latest viral sound effect—ewokie levels, though."
'Hits different' was all over my feed today, and honestly, I couldn't help but vibe to it. Like, that energy is unmatched. 'Gyatt' for sure, that's such a vibe. My friends were cracking jokes about 'oomfie' the other night, and I just couldn't stop laughing. It’s so casual yet relatable. 'Bala' though, I’m still trying to figure out what exactly it means. Is it like a new slang term or just someone’s name? Either way, it’s catchy. We were talking about this whole 'Situationship' thing too, and honestly, it’s the most meta thing ever. Just when you think you’ve got it figured out, life throws something else at you. 'Ate' is all I can say. The world needs more of that energy. And while we’re at it, let’s not forget about 'clout.' That’s just facts. And 'fanum tax,' oh man, that’s the ultimate flex. You know what I mean? Just bringing in the bag and repping your own brand.
"i’m literally bet for this TikTok challenge! have you seen the grimace shake video? 😂 so delulu and frfr when you’re trying to keep it cool but really not. my baddie status is on point though, no cap."  

"you’re telling me you haven’t seen ‘not them’ yet? 😂 bet your fave TikTokker is doing the L move in their next video. delulu energy is just too much sometimes, frfr."  

"i’m not here for this ‘bala’ trend—when did it become cool to just stand there and do nothing but flex? my baddie aesthetic is strong AF though."
'What’s up with the kids talking about “lore” lately? It’s so random.', 'She was just vibing in her room all day, no big deal.', 'OMG, did you see “hits different” trending? That move was lit!', "Sir/ma'am, can you pass the remote?", 'That new TikTok trend is so vamp, like, where did it come from?', 'Yo, Ohio's been popping up everywhere—what’s that about?', 'I was just vibing in the park, chillin', 'The group chat was lit af—so many jokes, it was hits different!', 'You gotta catch "vamp" trends before they blow up.', 'Who even knew "lore" would take over the internet?’, 'Sir/ma'am, I’m trying to vibe, not judge you.']
be like "yo, this outfit be so fr"  
"i kyk when ur friend gatekeep u for weeks but u ended up mewin' them back."  
"u think i’m just delulu’ing? no, im tryna spill the tea on ur toxic ass."  
"this plot be so lit, do it for the plot, or stay quiet."  
"she’s been bussin' off the bag since day one, and it’s fr fr."  
"u know when u see someone who’s too extra? that’s iykyk energy."  
"can’t believe ur friend still gatekeep ur secrets like a mewling baby."  
"this drama be so sick, do it for the plot, or leave."  
"u’re honestly delulu' if u think i’m just bussin’ for attention."  
"be so fr with ur fashion choices? i’ll spill the tea on that too."

1. Big yikes! That new TikTok trend is lit—gucci af.
2. Did u see that ratio? Like, where did they get those angles from?
3. Clownery at its finest—those videos are giving me life!
4. I’m all about that vibe check—it’s giving major situationship energy.
5. Pressing play on this new TikTok challenge already—so iconic.
6. Ugh, the flex was strong AF—gucci season for sure.
7. This edit is giving me big yikes and then some.

11. Pressing follow for more of this energy—straight up gucci vibes.
12. Big yikes over here—I’m dying for that flex.
13. That ratio was on point—DNA levels, no cap.
14. Clownery at its core—just pure unboasted greatness.
15. This edit is giving me all the big yikes and zero FOMO.

 
"yo i was just vibing and saw this lit af tiktok and had to comment sigma bc the energy was just too muchddd"  
"babygirl why u always gotta be so delulu about everything lmfao"  
"okay so like the plot twist at the end tho i was not expecting it at all bogged AF"  
"this one time my friend was like oh my glizzy this is spicy and i was like yeahhh we’re dead"  
"people are always like do it for the plot but sometimes u just gotta do it for yourself right?🤷♂️"  
"yeah I’m kinda feeling these vibes rn bc the energy is so strongdddd"  
"haha my friend kept calling me sigma last night and honestly it was ICONIC"
Let me tell you, this "bussin" is off the charts right now.  
When your girlboss level is unmatched, but you're still sneaky linking with your squad at 3 AM—classic Gen Z energy!  
The "kai cenat" trend? Yeah, that's been blowing up for a while now.  
"Clowning" in TikTok challenges? Oh, you haven't seen anything until you've seen the latest viral videos.  
"Sigma" levels are high, but we're all just trying to keep up with the fast-paced culture.  
It's like, "lore" is everywhere—whether it's in meme captions or casual conversation.  
You can't escape it, but that's what makes it so fun, right?  
The way we talk now is literally a whole new language.  
Stay "bussin," stay "sneaky," and keep clout-chasing because that's just how it goes.
The doggo had the audacity to gatekeep the snacks, so we had to ratio them out. 
I’m not here for that lore, though—everyone knows it’s all about the extra vibing. 
Ohio is literally the worst place for a ewokie hangover, but hey, maybe I should just let it eepy and move on.
 No one wants a gatekeeper like me, so I’ll just keep my ratio on point. If anyone tries to play "not them," they’re getting the fullbruh treatment.
My POV was always behind the scenes, watching everyone else have all the fun.  
She had the babygirl vibe down pat—always knew exactly what to do or say.  
He’s just an NPC in my life, never adding anything meaningful to the conversation.  
The GOAT thing is real, like when she brought up that hidden talent for cooking.  
I was vibing hard on this new playlist, but it just wasn’t hitting the right spots.  
It’s not every day you meet your babygirl best friend who gets you like that.  
Her “slay” energy was contagious, always turning heads wherever we went.  
I gave her a sideways grimace shake because I couldn’t handle her latest drama.  
If anyone needs a POV on the situation, it’s me—always in the know.
Skrilix: Ugh, my "mood" is just… off. Like, SpicyBoi was tryna hit me with "lore," but I’m still trying to get outta this "fire" zone.  

SpicyBoi: Hey, don’t “sigma” on me! If you’re feeling "highkey" vibes, let’s make it happen.  

Skrilix: Alright, my "bestie," let’s get into this. I’ve been seeing too many "NPCs" in my feed, and honestly, it’s giving me "mood" whiplash.  

SpicyBoi: Yeah, that “lore” is extra sus. And don’t even get me started on these "sigma" energy people. They’re all like, "I’m over it," but then they’re back sliding into your DMs.  

Skrilix: Exactly! We need to call out the "NPCs" for real. They’re just going through the motions without any personality.  

SpicyBoi: And the "mood" swings? Like, one second you’re highkey vibing, next you’re over it. It’s so confusing.  

Skrilix: True. But at least we’ve got each other to vent to. You my "bestie," always.  

SpicyBoi: Same, my "Mewing" queen. Let’s keep the "lore" going and never let those "NPCs" get us down.  

Skrilix: On it! Next "fire" challenge, we’re out.  

SpicyBoi: ✨

"Yo, did you see that Sigma energy in the group chat? Ewww, that's some next-level clownery. 
The ick is so real when your crush doesn't text back. NPCs are literally everywhere, like how they just ignore you in the DMs. 
GOAT status for sure, though—those collabs were fire. Clowning at its finest. This brainrot energy is unboi, though."

3. We were vibin' in the kitchen, and then [Name] came in spilling cereal everywhere.
4. Touch grass, man! You've been cooped up for days, your bestie's wondering why you're MIA.
5. I told him to simp, but he just kept eating chips outta the bag.

"Ugh, my friend keeps talking about 'big yikes' whenever something wild happens. Did you see that video where they did the 'grimace shake' during the live? So extra, right?"  
"I heard about this new slang called 'delulu.' It's like when someone is being so dramatic online, and their friends just laugh and say 'lore' because it's so cringe."  
"My cousin tried to explain 'fanum tax' to me, but I was too busy thinking they were just trying to sound cool. Anyway, I ended up looking it up later."
I’m Pookie, like, spilling all the tea about how my crush sent me "sending me" vibes but then ghosted me. I’m still over here trying to figure out why he’s so "sigma," probably because he’s scared of getting caught with his secret "rizz" game. Anyway, let’s talk about that TikTok challenge where you have to say "spill" every time someone mentions their pet's name—my cat is named Whiskers, but she’s all about the "ick."  

Let me rizz you with some facts: I once tried to explain my love for skibidi toilet memes, and no one believed me until I showed them the viral video. But now they’re all like, "Oh, you were right," which is kind of satisfying but also a bit cringe. And if someone ever tries to throw shade at my sigma level, I’m gonna be like, "You wish," because I know the moves.  

The ick is real, though. My friend tried to explain TikTok slang to her parents, and they were just like, "What?" So, yeah, we’re all trying to keep this culture alive before it gets too old. But if you ever see me spilling tea about someone else, know that I’m just cooking up some facts—literally.  

Let him cook, literally. My brother once said that to my mom, and she was like, "What?" But now we’re all in on the chaos. So, yeah, keep sending me, because this brainrot is real, but it’s also kinda lit.
1. "I was just clowning with my friends earlier, but then they started talking about serious stuff."
2. "She’s been gaslighting me all day with her antics."
3. "This new TikTok trend is so grimy, I can’t even handle it."
4. "He came up with the biggest yikes when we tried to plan our next move."
5. "I’m trying to get into this new lore about influencers, but it’s so confusing."
6. "We were just mewing over this viral video that’s taking over the internet."
7. "It’s giving me all the big yikes every time I scroll through my feed."
I can't include quotation marks or emojis, but I can provide some creative text chunks using the words you've mentioned:

- "Situationships are the most low-key but also the most snatched."  
- "Eepy stuff always comes out of nowhere."

7. That “spill” was fire, honestly.  
8. Why are you acting like that wasn’t a "skibidi"?  
9. I’m not trying to be your "main character," okay?  
10. Honestly, the way they’re "maxxing" is giving me life.  
11. If you’ve got a "sneaky link," let’s go!  
12. Who even tries to use "ratio" as a serious metric anymore?  
13. “Not them” energy is low-key my spirit animal.

15. She’s claiming her “baddie status,” but I know the truth.  
16. You’re not the only one maxxing—let’s see it!  
17. That “sneaky link” led me to the best TikTok viral moment ever.  
18. If you’re here trying to "ratio" my life, I’m not interested.  
19. Honestly, when someone says “not them,” I’m like… who else could they possibly be?  
20. The amount of times I’ve been on a “spill” is honestly embarrassing.

Hey girl, your outfit today is straight GOAT, like legit, I’m so jealous! You’ve really got that edge, no cap. Did you get it from that new store or what? My style has been so basic lately, but I was about to cop these kicks too, which would’ve made me bussin’. We should probably hang out later and flex our situationships, right? So much flexing, so little time! By the way, did you see that TikTok about the new Viral trend? It’s kinda giving me FANUM TAX vibes. Also, I’m seriously considering getting a "babygirl" aesthetic for my Insta, like full babydoll outfits and cute accessories—too much, but too cute. My friends are always calling me basic, but honestly, if it’s about the GOAT stuff, I’m unbothered! Let’s make plans soon, we’ll be out here looking L in no time.

"Yo, did you see that TikTok? High Key flexing in the parking lot after school—Pookie got those wheels! I’m so grindset right now, like, I can’t even chill."  

"Ugh, my main character energy is just not there today. Why am I always on the edge of everything cool? It’s giving me vibes but not in a good way."

"I’m just here vibing, you know? Like, chilling with my homies and stuff. We’re out here being extra, ’cause why not? I’m in my Sigma zone right now, cruising through the day with no worries. Maybe I’ll hit up my Babygirl later, send her a glizzy or something wild. Don’t want to rizz too hard, though—still got some mewing to do. Honestly, life’s a clowning show sometimes, and I’m just along for the ride."
My outfit was lit, everyone was asking where I got it from.  
The wings were vibe, but the fries were extra.  
Ugh, why is FOMO so real right now?  
Did you see that TikTok?  
I’m feeling like a Babygirl today, so extra.  
We need to do it for the plot, for sure.  
Ratio or go home, honestly.  
Can’t believe they deleted the video, who asked for a lobotomy?  
If you’re not droppin’, you’re not doing it right.  
It’s so hard to find a ratio these days.  
FOMO is real, but I’m over it.  
I bet they didn’t think about fanum tax when they made this.

"Did you see how she mewed last night? That was so bussin'. She had me cracking up with her 'be so fr' energy. Honestly, I'm still recovering from the GOAT status she threw on herself. Can't believe anyone could be that lit."

"Remember when we were trying to figure out if 'lobotomy' was a real word or just some meme? Now, it's basically our go-to term for when someone acts like they've had their brain surgically altered to only think in TikTok terms."

"I'm over here just trying to be so fr about my life, but honestly, seeing the GOAT in action makes me feel like I'm living in a simulation. Like, how can one person be so bussin' at all times?"

"Did you know that 'NPC' is now our term for anyone who doesn't understand the brainrot slang? It's wild how it's become a whole new language." 

"I'm sorry, but if someone mewed in my presence and didn't immediately make me feel like I was living in a world where the GOAT existed, then they can't be trusted. Just saying."

- Kai cenat, bro, like, "it's giving" energy but also super cringy.  
- Glazing the chicken for dinner? Sounds like a flex, though.  
- "Gen alpha" is lit, right? They growth they wisdom.  
- Clownery at its core is just pure unapologetic fun.  
- Mewing over cute cats all day—can't deny it.  
- Chungus energy is real when you're just vibing hard.  
- Ohio or nah? Honestly, the midwest has its own vibe.  
- It's giving me life, but also, like, "I'm dead inside."  
- Can't believe the glazing on this steak—it's fire!  
- Gen alpha thinks they invented the internet, though.  
- Clownery levels are high when you pull off a viral TikTok.  
- Mewing about how cute babies are? Basic, but can't hate it.  
- Chungus or not? Depends on the flex level.  
- "It's giving me everything," except my sleep schedule.  
- Glazing it up—literally, like grilling with flair.  
- Kai cenat and vibe on point? Unbothered.  
- Ohio nights are wild, but also, where's the slushie?  
- Gen alpha slang is too much, though, am I right?  
- Clownery in the comments? 10/10, always.  
- Mewing over aesthetics until my eyes bleed.  
- Chungus energy when you're just here for the vibes.  
- "It's giving me everything," but also, it's a bit too much.  
- Glazing the bread—bread and butter, or bread and cheese?  
- Kai cenat like, "I'm wild," yeah, that's the vibe.  
- Ohio or nah? Depends on your vibe.
"Yo, did you see her ratio? She’s just out here spilling vibes like it’s no big deal."  
"I’m so over this NPC energy. Like, can’t we all just vibe without the extra drama?"  
"Be so fr when your friend asks you to pick me up, but you’re lowkey in NPc mode."  
"Everyone’s hitting different, but I’m just here trying to keep my clout clean."  
"Fanum Tax much? Like, can’t we all just mood without the extra fluff?"  
"I was ratio-ing her stories, and she hit different with that aesthetic."  
"Be so fr when you’re trying to flex your lit life, but it’s just vibe-checking over here."  
"NPC mode activated when someone starts talking about their ‘mood’ like it’s a crisis."  
"She’s out here spilling vibes, but I’m just over this extra."  
"Fanum Tax for sure when you’re trying to keep your lit life on point."  
"I’m so done with the ratio. Like, can’t we all vibe without comparing?"

1. OMG, did you see that Ohio? My ex was basic, but this is straight-up delulu.
2. She was like, "Hits different," and I was like, "Yeah, because her Mewing is on point!"
3. I told my Sigma friend, and she was like, "Slay or nah?"
4. The vibe was lit—definitely not basic, more like Mewing level.
5. When someone says "Sigma," it's either a compliment or a slight roast, depending on context.
6. My friends and I were so into this new trend called Skibidi that we decided to start our own group chat about it.
7. "This is lit," I said, using "Ohio" as code for something epic happening.
8. She had the Mewing heard 'round the clock—no cap.
9. We were all like, "Slay or nah?" and honestly, anyone who says no is probably delulu.
10. The energy was off the charts—I was living in my "Hits different" moment.

Ugh, I’m totally feeling FOMO for the party later. But, like, not in a bad way—more like a "main character" kind of vibe where I just gotta be myself.  

And omg, my friend tried to "rizz" me earlier, but it was so cringe. I was like, "pookie," you couldn’t pull that off.  

Pressing send on TikTok is such a "vibe" move, right? Like, you're just out here living your best life.

2. "I was gatekeeping my spot in line because I didn't want to wait forever, but it ended up being worth it."

4. "He's been so 'clowning' lately; it's like he can’t stop making these crazy moves."
5. "I can't believe how fast trends come and go now, like 'Chungus' one minute and forgotten the next."
6. "No cap, this new food spot is fire—Literally, it’s 'big yikes' good!"
7. "She's been trying to gatekeep her social media presence, but everyone's getting in on the action."
8. "This new challenge is so 'vamp,' you just have to go all-in or stay quiet."
9. "I don’t know about you, but I’m over it—like, ‘clowning’ too hard for my vibe."
10. "You’ve got to be ready to adapt because these trends come and go faster than a 'skibidi toilet' video."

"Yo, this new TikTok trend is so fire. I’m literally L because I didn’t catch it earlier."

"I heard someone dropped some mad tea about the latest viral challenge—everyone’s talking about it."

"Chungus energy is real when you’re just out there being your unapologetic self."

"My friend tried explaining fanum tax to me, and honestly, I’m still confused but hilarious."

"Lit af, this season of TikTok is giving major vibes. Can’t stop, won’t stop."

"Sometimes you just gotta accept that you’re feeling L, no matter what."

"POV when ur crush ignores u but ur friends are like 'yeah she's probably busy' and u just sit there feeling sigma but still mewing ur pain into the void bc u can't rizz hard enough to get her attention. Ohio really knows how to do road trips tho, winding through endless highways with Sus energy, always questioning why everyone isn't as Into it as u are. Yeah,NPCs are lit af, just standing there taking it all in like they've got a sigma grindset of their own."

Clownery at its finest, right? vibes on fleek. Iykyk, my aesthetic is on point. You in or what? 😂 Say sike, you catching feels too? Rizz mode activated! 🙃"

"Ayo, you know where the NPC is? They’re out here serving looks."  
"Does anyone else think she’s just giving vibes or nah?"  
"Let her cook while we vibe on this playlist,"  
"I’m literally about to gyatt out the window,"  
"Wanna edge up those looks or nah?"  
"Sooo, you either L on this or you ball."

20. It's giving me sus levels again.  

Maxxing over here trying to act cool but honestly just deadass flexing. Glizzy up, let’s get that L somewhere. "It's giving" vibes are strong, and sneaky links always have extra. NPC energy is real when you’re just chilling, not participating in the drama. Yeah, that’s the vibe.
"sir/ma'am, why u always be so extra?"  
"Mewing is lit when ur fawx is cute."  
"let them cook, honestly, u can't handle it."  
"do it for the plot, u know u love it."

"lit af, can't even lie."

"clowning on my own but still spilling tea."

1. "Did you see that 'hot girl walk' trend? She was just walking around like she owned the place!"
2. "You're such an NPC, always just standing there without saying anything."
3. "Kai cenat is basically the new 'let them cook,' right? It's all about taking control."
4. "I bet you didn't think about 'cap' when someone told you that story—it was wild!"
5. "Wearing 'drip' and 'ate' is basically a fashion statement saying, 'I'm cool with it.'"


  - "Hey, have you seen the new 'hot girl walk' challenge? It's taken over all our feeds!"
  - "And man, everyone's either doing the 'NPC' thing or just trying to 'bet' their friends about it."
  - "Kai cenat is so on trend right now. I think it's about embracing your inner 'let them cook' moment."

  - "I was like, 'I'm not an NPC anymore!' and started my own 'hot girl walk.'"
  - "My friends were like, 'You're just cap-ing it all up!' But I didn't care, I was owning it."

1. "She’s been Stan-ing over that group since last month."

10. "She’s been acting extra salty since the breakup." 

"i’m lowkey just here to vibe and flex my sus clout, ya feel me?  
they’re like ‘babygirl’ this or that, but not them, bc not everyone’s sus enough.  
ohio’s vibe is lit, tbh, but gucci AF.  
delulu? give it a rest, pls.  
sus much? yeah, definitely.  
lore? nope, don’t care about your 'lore.'  
spill the details or get lost.  
vibe harder or don’t exist."
That's a 'slay' move, for sure! Honestly, I'm just here scrolling through TikTok, trying not to get too lost in the endless algorithms. UwU, my brain is just... *chef's kiss* tired of all this brainrot. Like, "touch grass" moments are scarce these days. I was vibing earlier, thinking about how "gyatt" is literally the vibe of my life right now. Frfr, it's like the universe is just throwing everything at me and I'm just over here trying to keep up. Kai, this is wild!
bussin energy right now, lit af on TikTok, oppenheimer style flexing in the kitchen, hot girl walk in the hallway, leonardo dicaprio walking with the drip, vibin' with my crew, let him cook that spaghetti, bogged AF on schoolwork.

1. "Yo, 'on God' this burger is so good!"
2. "Why you always using 'ratio'? Let's see your feed."
3. "I'm trying to get my 'simp energy' up for the next flex."
4. "This playlist has been on repeat—'it's giving' every vibe I need."

"Yo, this TikTok drama is so lit, I can't stop watching!"  
"Did you see how High Key that move was? Everyone's losing their minds."  
"My friend is just so delulu about this one person, it's hilarious and cringe at the same time."  
"I'm over here trying to get some clout, but no one's even noticing my vibe."  
"The tea on this situation is wild—I need to spill it ASAP."  
"Sigma grindset for sure, that person is killing the game."  
"Leonardo DiCaprio walking into a room? Yeah, hits different."  
"Like, L, are you serious right now?"
My friend tried to explain TikTok trends to me, but all I could think about was how sus her "main character energy" was.  
I was vibing and then I just ate all the chips because why not?  
The group chat was so lit—everyone was boggled by how cool the last viral meme was.  
Let them cook, I thought as my friend prattled on about something unimportant.  
"I ate too much pasta," I groaned, but honestly, I was living for those carbs.  
The TikTok algorithm is just… sus, right? It knows what we want before we do.  
I was so wasted from last night's brainrot that I could barely string a sentence together.  
"Fanum tax?" my friend asked, and I knew they were trying to trip me.  
The energy in the chat was pure main character vibes—everyone was shining.  
I'm still boggled by how quickly TikTok trends come and go like forgotten memés.  
Let them cook, I told myself as I scrolled through another endless feed of content.  
"Are you sus or not?" someone asked, and I just nodded because obviously, I was.  
Theewwwwww, I thought as I saw an ewokie in the comments—it was too much.  
I ate a whole bag of popcorn while watching the latest TikTok drama unfold.  
The chat was lit—everyone was vibing, main character energy flowing freely.  
Why is it always fanum tax when I try to be casual with my crush?  
"I'm so wasted," I muttered, but honestly, brainrot had me feeling alive.  
The algorithm is sus—it knows what we want before we even ask.  
I can't believe my crush called me an ewokie for not liking Star Wars.  
Let them cook, I thought as the group chat kept going off with endless memes.  
"I ate too many snacks," I said to no one, because why not?  
The main character energy was high, but the sus vibes were even higher.  
Boggled doesn't even cover how confused I am about this TikTok drama.  
Let them cook, I told myself again, because patience is a virtue… or something.  
My friend kept saying "fanum tax" until I literally had to ask what it meant.  
The chat was lit—vibes were strong, and the energy was off the charts.  
I ate a whole pizza while scrolling through TikTok's endless brainrot feed.  
"Are you sus or not?" someone asked, and I just said "Sus, of course."  
The algorithm is sus—it knows what we want before we even type a search.  
TikTok trends come and go like forgotten memés, and honestly, it's wild.  
I was vibing in the park when my friend hit me with a main character energy check.  
Boggled doesn't cover how I felt when I saw the latest TikTok drama unfold.  
Let them cook, I thought as I waited for the next viral meme to drop.  
"I ate too much," I said to no one because brainrot had me forgetting my own name.  
The chat was lit—everybody was sus, vibing, and living their best life.  
Fanum tax is real, and honestly, I'm just here for the chaos of it all.
r u vibin' or nah?  
That new TikTok dance to "spill the tea" is lit.  
I'm so glazing my homie with these drip vibes.  
You know what I mean, right? Like, "iykyk" levels are high.  
We're out here clowning, no cap.  
The energy was straight up bussin'.  
Let me ask you, are we gonna let them cook or nah?  
Yo, that's some next-level rizz, for real.  
Ohio representing hard with the swag vibes.  
Can't even front about it, it's just too fire.
"Yo, that 'baddie' energy is so strong right now, where you getting it from?"
"Did your friend ever explain the 'oomfie' thing? I'm still lost."
"I can't stop laughing at how 'eepy' people are being these days."
"Couldn't believe the viral 'Glazing' trend; it's everywhere!"
"FOMO is no joke, like I'm always missing out on the cool stuff."
"That 'Ohio' reference had me rolling for hours."
"She's got such a vamp aesthetic in her Insta stories."
"The skibidi toilet video has to be seen to believe."
"Did you see how zaza was just mellowing about gen alpha? I bet she's been grinding that lore nonstop. Grindset much? Pick me already! 😜 No, seriously, mewing over those bet vibes is not cute. Delulu much? Bet you're still on that grindset. Zaza, though, she's out here like, 'pick me, pick me!' I'm not gen alpha, but I can feel the lore in the air. Grindset and zaza together? Mewing for sure. Bet you can't handle this delulu level. Pick me, pick me! 😜"
"baddie whodat?  
I’m spilling on the ‘GOAT’ trend right now.  
Why you always with the sneaky link?  
My vibe today is straight "NPC" mode.  
She’s got the Ohio swag like no cap.  
Let’s get this bag, it’s too much to cap.  
You know I’m a baddie when I’m flexing my own style.  
The GOAT combo is just *chef’s kiss*.  
I’m over this “spill” already, can’t handle the drama.  
NPCs are just extra players in this TikTok game.  
No cap, she’s bringing the heat with her "Ohio" flair."

1. "That move was so lit—straight up iconic."  
2. "Be so fr with it, like extra level vibes."  
3. "Her energy? Pure main character mode."  
4. "You know what I mean, cap—it’s always that."  
5. "This vibe is just… grimy AF, honestly."  
6. "I’m dead, like, literally dead because this was too good."  
7. "Don’t play with me—my clout’s strong, don’t mess."  
8. "Wasn’t that delulu for you to not notice?"  
9. "Let’s go, my main character is ready to slay."  
10. "So extra, but honestly, I’m here for it."  

"Yo, did you see that glazing? So extra af!"  
"Let’s just drip all over this aesthetic."  
"You’re literally slayin’ in these photos, though."  
"Why are we always talking about NPC energy? Like, why can’t we have our own sigma moment?"  
"Did you know ‘Ohio’ is the new ‘Vibing.’"  
"She’s been on TikTok for 5 seconds and already got a skibidi aesthetic."  
"Whew, that was such a vibe—glazed, slay, drip, and all!"  
"NPCs are just here to watch us slay, am I right?"  
"Need more sigma in my life, pls."  
"’Ohio’ is the new way to flex your TikTok IQ."  
"Someone explain why ‘drip’ isn’t a verb yet."

"Delulu I’m not here for that, extra, situa*ship gone wrong, stan for life, rizz everywhere, chungus energy, NPC mode, highkey goals."  

"I’m so extra right now, like, situa*ship vibes but no one’s vibe-ing back, Stan someone harder please, Delulu this is literally my vibe, rizz without effort, Chungus facts, and NPCheckin’ my vibe."

"Highkey, I need to stan someone who’s not just a basic extra, but a full-on Delulu situation, cause situa*ships are overrated, and rizz is in the air. Chungus energy for days, and don’t even get me started on NPC mode. Extra AF, yeah."

"Extra much, like situa*ship levels are low-key stressful, but stan someone who’s got the Delulu energy to spare. Rizz so hard it’s contagious, Chungus facts always, and don’t get me wrong, I’m in full NPC mode right now."  

"I’m all about this extra life, no Situationship drama, just Stan people who give me that Delulu glow. Rizz like it’s my spirit animal, Chungus energy keeps me going, and NPCheckin’ every day is lit. Highkey goals for sure."

"Delulu vibes are real, extra everything, situa*ship drama? No thank you, stan someone who’s got the rizz on lock, Chungus facts forever, and don’t even get me started on NPC mode. Extra level up!"  

"This is all extra AF, situa*ships are overrated, I’m here to Stan some real Delulu energy, Rizz like it’s my name, Chungus facts always, and NPCheckin’ my vibe every time."  

"Highkey, this is the life—extra everything, no Situationship drama, just Stan people who’re all about that Delulu energy. Rizz so hard I can’t even, Chungus vibes for days, and don’t get me wrong, I’m in full NPC mode."
sure, here’s some natural text containing the requested words:  
"deadass tried to rizz me again with that weak af game, but i’m not having it."  
"chungus was at the party, grinning like he invented the grimace shake."  
"i was just about to sigma grindset when my clout got ruined by a skibidi toilet situation."  
"pov when you ask for chicken and they give you a ketchup dip instead of sauce."  
"deadass thought he could rizz the teacher, but she was having none of it."  
"my homie was flexing his sigma grindset, but i knew he wasn’t really that lit."  
"they say clout is everything, but i’m over it like a skibidi toilet."  
"pov when you’re trying to rizz and your brain just won’t let you keep up."  
"chungus was vibing in the car, doing the grimace shake to the beat."  
"deadass didn’t know what hit him when his sigma grindset backfired."  
"my friends are always talking about their clout, but it’s getting old, honestly."  
"pov when you’re trying to be cool and end up looking like a deadass fool."

1. I was vibing when she said "say sike rn," and we ended up crashing the party.
2. He's been pressing about starting a new project but seems unsure about his commitment.
3. She’s been delulu about her new hobby, talking about it non-stop.
4. We’ve been in this situahtivity for months without a clear direction.
5. Pressing has become a term I’m learning to understand better, often meaning urgency.
6. My friend mentioned "hits different" when describing her date last night.
7. She introduced "fanum tax" and left without explaining it, leaving me curious.

hits different though  
clout flexing hard today  
it's giving major vibes  
low-key flexing on my friend but don't tell anyone  
this TikTok is bussin right now  
situationships are lit rn  
ayy my bala's been on fleek all day  
she's out here giving major clout with her latest move  
I'm low-key envying my friend's flex but I'll never let them know  
this one is giving straight-up bussiness  
honestly I just want a situationhip where I can vibe out without any drama  
my energy is so extra right now it's not even funny  
you know what I mean?
"Yo, I was just scrolling through TikTok and saw this viral 'Lore' video. It was so cringe but also kind of hilarious, you know? Like, where did they even find these people? Anyway, moving on, I heard someone got ghosted by their own shadow in a TikTok challenge. That's wild, right? And don't get me started on the 'iykyk' trend—everyone's using it, but honestly, it's getting old. I'm over it. Plus, 'clowning' is everywhere now. Like, every other video is some kid trying to be the next big thing. But hey, at least it keeps the content fresh, even if it's a bit exhausting. Anyway, catch you later."


"Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend? It's all about being a 'stan' for your fave influencer. I'm definitely a stan for that one girl who makes meme compilations—big yikes, she's just too lit."

"I heard someone got ratio'd hard after trying to start a viral trend. But then again, it didn't really take off because people were like, 'That's clownery.'"

"NPCs are everywhere these days. My cousin was talking about how his friend is an NPC in a relationship—like, literally just a background character."

"Some people are so focused on being edgy that they forget what actual fun is. Like, when someone pulls out the 'Fanum Tax' line and nobody knows what it means—but they say it anyway, and we all laugh anyway."

"Sir/ma'am, I'm 23 and still love One Direction. Don't judge me. Also, if you think 'lore' is just about video games, then you're missing out on the real memes."

"Let’s vamp this convo—straight up GOAT energy vibes!"  
"Their ratio is on another level, no cap."  
"Did you see that glazing? It was lit AF, period."  
"Oppenheimer style, for real tho."  
"Taking a POV from the top, always."  
"No cap, that’s the vibe I’m spilling."  
"Keep it up, that’s the kind of ratio we’re here for."  
"Vamp mode activated, let’s go."  
"The GOAT flex is strong in this group."  
"POV switches on point, no cap."  
"Lit af, no doubts, straight up glazing."  
"Oppenheimer style for the win, no questions."  
"Ratio’s on fire, and I’m here for it."  
"Spill the tea—vamp level 100."  
"No cap, that’s the POV we’re seeing."  
"Flexing that GOAT energy all day."  
"Vamp this or go home."  
"Oppenheimer style—straight up legend status."  
"No cap, the ratio’s too clean."  
"POV or bust, let’s do it."  
"Lit af, and no doubts about it."  
"GOAT or not, we’re here to slay."  
"Vamp this, then fade out."  
"No cap, that’s the move."  
"Keep it up, and don’t stop glazing."  
"Oppenheimer style—next level flex."

"Hey, did you hear about that new TikTok trend where people are calling everything 'GOAT' or 'W'? Like, if someone asks for Directions and you respond with 'Doog' instead of 'Dog,' they’re probably gonna rizz so hard. Speaking of rizz, I saw this video where the person literally just said 'Sir/Ma'am' to their pet cat, and it was pure lore. Ewokie levels are high right now, honestly. Like, when someone refers to their crush as 'lore,' you know they’re 100% into it. And don’t even get me started on 'Mewing'—that’s straight-up G.O.A.T. status."
"Yo, that 'NPC' move was so extra! You really went full 'Pookie' on that."  
"Btw, don't even try to 'rizz' me with that stuff. I see right through it."  
"What's up? Did you just become a 'High Key'? You're acting like a whole new person."  
"Clout-wise, that move was lit! But honestly, it's not going to get you far."  
"Are you always this basic with the slang? Just 'clout' and 'rizz'?"  
"NPCs are everywhere these days. They’re basically the background noise of social media."  
"You should've seen my friend try to 'ratio' someone the other day—pure chaos!"  
"What's with everyone being so 'W'? Is it 2023 or did I miss something?"  
"Guys, stop with the 'L's already. One more and you're getting reported."  
"Do you think using 'Pookie' on your own friend is cool? Hard no."  
"High Key energy is one thing, but full-on 'clout-chasing' is just cringe."  
"Yo, if you're not here to 'ratio,' don’t even waste my time."  
"NPCs are like the background music of TikTok—constantly there but nobody really listens."  
"You can’t just throw out a 'rizz' and expect it to land. Some of us have self-respect!"  
"What’s with 'W' being the go-to insult now? It’s getting so tired."  
"Calling someone a 'Pookie' is the ultimate backhanded compliment these days."  
"If you’re not here to 'clout,' why are you even on the app?"  
"High Key or not, some moves are just straight-up sus."  
"Do you think using 'ratio' as slang is original? It’s been done a million times!"  
"NPCs are basically walking meme factories these days. They’re too easy to meme."  
"You can’t half-’rizz’ and expect it to work. Either go all in or don’t do it at all."  
"Are we still on the 'W' kick? It’s getting old, fast."  
"Calling someone a 'Pookie' is like calling them a fan favorite—sure, but with a twist."  
"High Key energy or not, you can’t just waltz into a conversation and drop a 'clout' reference without context."  
"NPCs are the unsung heroes of TikTok. They keep the content flowing but never get the spotlight."  
"You’re either all in on the 'rizz' or you’re not. There’s no halfway."  
"Do you think using 'ratio' is still cool? It feels so 2019."  
"High Key moves are cool, but they don’t change the fact that you’re still just a person."  
"NPCs might be the most relatable thing about TikTok right now."  
"You can't half-’clout’ and expect people to take you seriously. It's an all-or-nothing situation."  
"What’s with 'W' being the default insult for anyone who doesn’t meet your standards?"  
"Calling someone a 'Pookie' is like saying they’re a fan-favorite, but in a bad way."  
"If you're not here to 'ratio,' why are you even on TikTok? Let's be real."  
"High Key or not, some moves are just too extra for this generation."  
"Do you think using 'rizz' is still a thing? It’s starting to sound dated."  
"NPCs are the ultimate flexible friends—they’re always down but never ask for much in return."  
"You can’t half-’clout’ and expect it to count. Go big or stay quiet."  
"What’s with 'W' being the go-to for anyone who doesn’t fit your vibe? It’s so basic."  
"Calling someone a 'Pookie' is like calling them your favorite, but in a weird way."  
"If you're not here to 'ratio,' maybe it's time to log off and find some real friends."  
"High Key or not, we all know the difference between trying too hard and just being yourself."  
"NPCs are basically TikTok’s version of background characters—they exist but rarely speak."  
"You can’t half-’rizz’ and still expect credit. It’s an all-or-nothing kind of thing."  
"What’s with 'W' becoming the insult du jour? It’s getting repetitive, honestly."
When I told my friends about the spill in the kitchen, they went wild with questions. He kept doing this grimace shake whenever we talked about his crush, but I didn’t say anything. We ended up skibidi-ing around town, checking out all the cool spots. She’s been vibing so hard lately, always on her phone or hanging with friends. His clothes were so grimy from days at the park, but he didn’t seem to care. I sent him a text, sending me some new memes that were just too good.

bussin af, glazing on everything, ohioaaaaa, hits different bruh, gatekeep my name outta ur mouth, salty as heck, zaza, leonardo dicaprio walking through the mall, "yeah, that's so bussin," someone said.  
i was like, "ohio for sure," and we started comparing the slaps in our feed, "hits different, right?" but then she gatekept me with her aesthetic. i was salty af, honestly. "zaza" tho, she kept saying it nonstop, making me feel like i was walking through a glazing moment or something.  
"leonardo dicaprio walking" is straight iconic, like his energy, you know? and yeah, we ended up bussin over the snacks later, cause that hits different.
