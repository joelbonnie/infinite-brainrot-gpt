The fanum tax on this pizza is mad real.  
Youre basically an NPC sometimes, honestly.  
Lets talk about the viral baddie trend. Its basically the modern version of complimenting someone in public, right? And while were at it, whats with babygirl being thrown around so casually? Its cute but also a bit confusing. Have you heard glizzy becoming the new term for something sleek or cool? Im still figuring out its exact meaning. Oh, and ewokieis that just Star Wars fan speak now? Or is it something entirely different? Anyway, lets move on to delulu. If I had a dollar for every time Ive heard that word in the last month itd be enough for a new phone. And what about chungus? Is it the new dick move or just another slang term Im not in on? Honestly, Im starting to think were all just making up language as we go along.  
Did you catch the TikTok challenge where people are saying slay nonstop for  hours? Its exhausting but also kind of funny. And what about boggedis that the new way to say busy or is it something more specific? Im still not sure. But hey, if we cant agree on a single slang term, maybe we should just accept that were all speaking our own language now. Lets talk about grumpy cat being called chungus. Is that the official term for grumpy cats or is it just a meme inside certain communities? And while were at it, whats with mewing becoming a thing? Is that the new way to refer to cat noises or something else entirely? Honestly, Im starting to think these slang terms are less about communication and more about tribe signaling.  
Lets get back to sigma. Is it still cool to use that term or has it become overused? Im seeing it everywhere now, but Im not sure if thats a good thing. And what about balais that the new term for Bali or just another slang word? I think its just another slang term, but Im not entirely sure how its used. Anyway, lets talk about edgeit seems like the new term for being on the verge of something, whether its a trend or a relationship. And what about bussin? Is that the new way to say busy or is it something more specific? Im not entirely sure, but Ive heard it used in both contexts.  
Have you noticed how  NPC is being used to describe people who dont interact much online? Its kind of funny but also a bit sad. And what about fanum tax? Is that the new term for tolls or something else entirely? Im not sure, but it sounds like a madeup word. Anyway, lets move on to lolita being called babygirl. Is that the official term now or just another slang term? I think its becoming more of a joke term rather than something taken seriously. And what about rizz? It seems like its still popular, but Im not sure if its been replaced by anything else.  
Lets talk about glizzyis that the new way to describe something sleek or just another slang term? Im seeing it used in both contexts, so its a bit confusing. And what about grimy? Is that the new term for being in a bad mood or something else? Ive heard it used both ways, which makes it a bit tricky to pin down. Anyway, lets get back to slay. Is it still the goto term for impressive content or has it been replaced by something else? It seems like its still popular, but Im not sure how long thatll last.  
Did you hear about TikTok influencers using baddie as their tag and then selling merchandise with it? Thats wild. And what about zaza? Is that the new term for a cute or quirky behavior or something else? Ive heard it used in both ways, so its a bit confusing. Anyway, lets talk about edge. Is that the new term for being on the verge of something big, like a viral trend or a relationship? It seems like it is, but Im not sure how long thatll be around.  
Lets get back to rizz. Is it still the ultimate way to compliment someone online or has it lost its charm? I think its becoming more of a joke now, especially in certain communities. And what about bussin? Is that the new term for being busy or something else? Ive heard it used both ways, which makes it a bit hard to take seriously. Anyway, lets move on to chungus. Is that still the goto term for grumpy cats or is it becoming more of a meme within specific groups?  
Have you noticed how babygirl is being thrown around so casually now? It seems like its becoming more of a joke term rather than something taken seriously. And what about mewing? Is that the new way to refer to cat noises or just another slang term? Im not sure, but it sounds like its becoming part of internet culture now. Anyway, lets talk about slay. Is it still the ultimate term for impressive content or has it been replaced by something else? It seems like its still popular, but Im not sure how long thatll be.  
Lets get back to grumpy cat being called chungus. Is that the official term now or just a meme inside certain communities? I think its becoming more of a meme rather than something taken seriously. And what about mewing? Is that the new way to describe cat noises or just another slang term? It seems like its becoming part of internet culture, but Im not entirely sure how its used outside of that.  
Okay, so after all this, I think weve established that these slang terms are being used in a variety of ways. Some seem to be becoming more popular and others are being overused, while some might just be inside jokes or memes within specific communities. Its clear that language is evolving, and these slang terms are part of that evolution. But honestly, its a bit overwhelming to keep track of all of them and how theyre used.  
I guess the main takeaway here is that slang is always changing, and whats cool now might not be cool later. Plus, its probably impossible to know every single slang term and how theyre used across different communities. So, maybe its best to just enjoy the ride and embrace the fact that language is constantly evolving.  
So, in conclusion, while Ive tried to wrap my head around these new slang terms and understand how theyre being used, its clear that theyre part of a larger cultural shift where language is becoming more dynamic and inclusive. It might be overwhelming at times, but its also exciting to see how people are finding new ways to express themselves.

Gyatt, seriously? That was pure gold!  
Youre like a sigma queen, running the show.  
Cant believe she pulled up with that straightup flex.  
NPC levels, though? So extra and so on point.  
This energy is just too much, but in a good way.  
Situationship goals, right? Like, lowstress but high vibe.  
Iykyk, honestly, thats iconic for the books.  
Sigma grindset for sure, always on top of their game.
Sure! Here are some natural chunks of text containing the provided slang words
Yo, did you see that Gyatt in the group chat? He was spitting facts!  
Im so over this situationship. Its like a relationship but not really.  
Bro, youre living in a Sim worldNPC level vibes tho.  
Hey Babygirl, lets grab some Skibidi and chill later.  
My vibe is currently on pressing mode, cant stop thinking about it.  
Dude, that move was so rizz, Im still feeling it.  
Were basically a power couple, no? Like Sigma levels.  
Shes got the Glazing energy, cant compete with that.  
True, but HimHer is the vibe for the night.  
Everyones acting like they invented Blorbosmdh.  
Falling into this grindset again, ugh.  
Tax seasons here, but Im still in Delulu mode about that project.  
Yo, we gotta get our Edge back, this is getting too basic.  
Shes got the Mewing sounds on pointso relatable.  
UWU, its so cute when they dont know whats hit them.  
Let me know if you need more!
Gyatt man, did you see that video? So Rizz was in it, right? Like, he was just sitting there with his Blorbo energy, flipping through the Skibidi. I was like, Oh my God, hes such a Sigma! But then she pulled out a Fanum Tax and we all lost our minds.  
Hey, did you hear about that Situationship? It started when someone tried to Grindset too hard and ended up in the NPC zone. Thats basically when your friends stop caring because theyre too busy mewing over their own Lore.  
I was just thinking about how we all were into Glazing last summer, right? Like, everyone was doing it, and then suddenly it was replaced by Babygirl energy. Now its like, Oh, Im in my Blorbo phase! but honestly, were all just Deluluing about it.  
You know when youre trying to talk to your crush but end up being a Pookie? Like, you just wanna Siren them or something, but then you get too nervous and end up with UWU in your texts instead of something cool. Thats basically how I ended up in this Situationship nightmare.  
Oh, and dont even get me started on when everyone was screaming LORE!!! because they found out their ex was into some obscure niche fandom. We were all just sitting there like, We knew this was going to happen, because were all basically walking Glazing machines.

Yo, did you see that viral Skibidi challenge? It was lit AF, right? Like, everyone was doing it, and the sound effect was so grating but in a good way, you know? I could feel my brain rotting from just listening to it for five minutes.  
OMG, this new TikTok trend is out of control. People are losing their minds over itliterally, like theyre acting irrational or something. Im starting to think were all just one step away from fullblown brainrot.  
And dont even get me started on the Babygirl trend. I swear, if I hear that sound effect one more time, I might just lose my mind. Its like they designed it specifically to drive us all insane.  
Wait, did you hear about the Situationship trend? Yeah, its where people document their fake relationships for clout or something. Honestly, its so confusing and yet so relatable that I cant stop watching. But also, its making me question my own relationships, which is not cool.  
And Pookie? Ugh, thats been the goto slang word for months now. Like, everyones using it in every sentence. Its so overplayed, but somehow its still catchy. I dont know how to feel about it anymore.  
Oh, and the Glazing trendwhat is even happening there? Its like people are just standing around glazing, which honestly sounds like something youd do in a lab. But they make it look so cool and edgy.  
Im starting to think that Gen Z is just trying to outdo each other with more absurd slang every day. And honestly, Im here for it because its providing endless content for TikTok comedy.  
But also, its kind of scary how quickly these trends take over. One minute its Gyatt, the next its Rizz, and now its Pookie. Its like a neverending cycle of brainrotting slang.  
I wonder if well ever go back to simpler times or if this is just the new normal. I guess well have to endure it together, right?
Yo, thats such a Rizz move, honestly. Like, Gyatt up, Skibidi vibes. BTW, did you hear about the Sigma level flexing? No way, thats straightup Delulu energy right there. Im feeling this Grindset though, for real. The lore is so strong in this situationstraightup HimHer levels. Blorbo, tho? Like, cant even handle it. And the Situationships? So lit AF, man. But the Glazing is on full display. Puke, get a grip. Oh my God, the Babygirl energy is so strong Im losing it. And the NPC level? Like, who even knows anymore. But the Edge is real as everstraightup Mewing for days. Whats up with the Pressing? Its too much, honestly. But then again, no cap, its all about the UWU vibes. No Cap!
Hey, did you see that TikTok where they tried to pull off a Gyatt but obviously failed? So cringeworthy yet somehow relatable. Im dying over how they thought that would work.  
Wanna Rizz the person who keeps posting photos of their Skibidi in the group chat? Like, we all know its just them flexting their imaginary fame.  
Bro, dont even get me started on the new Sigma trend. Everyones acting like they invented being extra, but Im here for itextra points for style, at least!  
UWU is literally the only acceptable reaction to most of this stuff, right? Like, if youre not using UWU, are you even Gen Z?  
The Glazing trend has officially reached peak level. Im over it, but also cant stop watching the videos.  
FANUM TAX FOR SURE. Like, why else would people be so extra about their Situationships status? Its all just performance art at this point.  
And dont even get me started on how everyones scrambling to use Pressing now that its been overused. Irony much?  
WAIT, the Babygirl trend is back? But honestly, Im here for it because Ive always been a Babygirl in my own quiet, yearold way.  
NPC levels are off the charts right now. Like, cant we just accept that some people are naturally boring? Or is that not allowed?  
This whole Delulu thing has reached peak confusion. Who even knows whats true anymore?  
Gotta respect the Grindset thoughwhen your job is so unbothered its basically a Grindset in action.  
Pressing over everything? Like, if youre not pressing for something specific, arent you just wasting your time?  
Pookie is honestly the only acceptable term for anyone whos ever had a dog. Fact.  
Mewing for hours over a viral videoyes, yes, Im living my best Mewing life.  
Bro, the way people are using Blorbo now? Its like they found the ultimate flex and never looked back.
Alright, lets get into it. Heres a dataset full of modern TikTok slang and conversational phrases
Yo, did you see Gyatt in math class today? He was spitting facts!  
Im so over this situmship. Its been three weeks, and I dont even know where we stand.  
Shes such a NPC, just standing there like a lost puppy.  
Hes got the Rizz, man. One look at him and youre melted like butter in the sun.  
Im in my Ohio period right now, all about those big, baggy clothes and no care in the world.  
Shes out here glazing everyone with her soft, boppy energyso relatable!  
Why are we even still in this grindset? Like, wheres the fun in it?  
Im shipping him so hard right now, like hes my one and only Pookie.  
Shes been on that babygirl vibe all week, and Im here for itso precious!  
Cant believe theyre still in this delulu phase, acting like everythings a crisis.

This is giving me pressing vibes for sure. Like, when you cant stop thinking about it.  
Shes been mewing about her UWU moments nonstopbut Im here for it!  
And there you have itauthentic, casual conversations filled with TikTok slang!
Mew, did you see Bro go full Gyatt earlier? He was spitting facts about Rizz and how its lit AF. I swear, that kid could start a trend with his Glazing skills. Oh, and dont get me started on Ohio vibestheyre just too much sometimes. Maybe he should chill with the Blorbo and focus on his Situationship. Ugh, so relatable, right?

Grindset is so strong right now. Pressing too hard, Im here for it. Sirens calling, gotta answer. Pookie, youre the cutest, honestly. Mewing all day every day, no regrets. UWU forever!
Gotta love how Gyatt took over TikTok overnight! Wasnt expecting that!
Rizz is the ultimate flex, but also so cringe when its forced.
Skibidi season is here, and honestly, its everything!
My Sigma levels are high right now, cant stop thinking about it!
Fanum Tax is real, like when your friend hits you up for cash.
Edge moments are the best, but also the most unpredictable.
Babygirl energy is on point, but sometimes its just too much.
Bussin through TikTok trends, gotta keep up or get left behind!
NPC energy is when youre just going with the flow.
Glazing all day, gotta make sure youre in on the grind!
Sure! Heres a sample of natural, conversational text containing the provided slang terms
Yo, did you see that new TikTok? The person kept saying Gyatt instead of What. So funny!  
My homie was trying to be cute and used Rizz on me, but I just rolled my eyes like, Pog.  
Weve been in this Situationship for two months now, and Im over it.  
That guys been spamming NPC jokes nonstopget a life!  
I cant stop laughing at how theyre saying Babygirl as a compliment now.  
Did you see the viral Bussin challenge? Im still recovering from the aesthetics.  
My crush keeps using Pressing on meIm not a button, tho.  
UWU is literally everywhere nowlike, how many times do I have to remind you?  
I told my friend about the Glazing trend and he called me basic for bringing it up.  
The way they say Sigma when someones acting extra? So relatable!  
This Delulu energy is giving me secondhand embarrassment.  
Im pretty sure the person who invented Blorbo needs help.  
Why do kids keep saying HimHer instead of just using names?  
The Fanum Tax memes are hilariousbut also confusing AF.  
This Grindset thing is honestly exhausting.  
Gyatt, man, Im so gone for this new TikTok slang. Like, Rizz is such a vibe, but Skibidi sounds like something youd say when youre too high. Wait, Sigma though? Thats when someones got all the answers and you just gotta respect it. Oh, and Fanum Tax? Im not even sure what that means, but it feels like its gonna be the next big thing. Anyway, back to this Edge thingyeah, weve all been there when youre cruising through life, and then you hit that edge where everything just clicks. Babygirl is so cute, though. Like, if I called my homie Babygirl, shed be rolling. But hey, its all good as long as were vibing. Speaking of vibes, Bussin is when the energy is just off the charts. You know that feeling when youre in the zone? Thats bussin. And dont even get me started on NPClike, are you seriously telling me Im not an NPC? No way, my auras way too strong for that. Plus, Ive got a glowup planned this weekend, so Ill be shining brighter than the sun. Glazing sounds like something you do with your eye contactlike staring so hard it glazes over. And yeah, Lore is when youre spitting facts that no ones ever heard before, but somehow everyones like, Oh my god, where did you learn this? You know what I mean? Its lit. HimHer vibes are always on point, right? Like, when your crush hits you with the Him energy, its just pure chaos in your brain. Blorbo sounds like something from the cryptlike a shadowy figure in the dark, probably with extra sauce. Situationships are the worst, though. You think its casual, but then feelings get involved, and everyones like, Why is this so hard? Delulu is when youre just living your best life, no room for haters. Grindset is when youre in that zone where everythings clicking, and youre unstoppable. Pressing is when youve got the facts, but youre still waiting on that final pushlike, pressing send on that text youve been staring at forever. Siren is when you hit that peak moment, and it feels like the whole worlds paying attention. Pookie is just pure adorableness, right? Like, when your pet does something too cute to handle. Mewing? Yeah, thats straight up cat person energy, no doubt about it.
Alright, lets get this done! Heres some conversational text containing those TikTok slang words
OMG, that was such a Gyatt move! Did you see how she Rizzed the whole place? Im dead, like, literally dead. Also, did anyone else notice howNPC that guy was acting? Just standing there, glazing everyone with his lore. And seriously, why does my brain keep saying Babygirl when I try to sleep? Its so frustrating! But hey, at least we can all agree that Grindset is real and were all in it together. Lets mew about it later, yeah?
Im cringing because my ex tried to hit me with that rizz again, but honestly, Im over it. Like, were both adults now, right? Anyway, my friend just sent me a TikTok where theyre doing these viral glazing challengesso meta, but also kinda cool. Did you see how theyre layering glasses in reverse?
The other day, I was scrolling through and saw someone asking if pookie is a real term or just from that one viral video. And dont even get me started on the babygirl trendeveryones doing it, but tbh, its so cute when they dont realize how basic it looks.  
Oh, and Ive been seeing situation ship being used everywherelike, when youre in that toxic relationship zone but still cant let go. My friends been calling her ex sigma nonstop, which is just funny because shes basically applying the same logic to everyone else now.  
This whole lore thing has taken over my feed too. Everyones sharing their own weird stories about why they love their sidekick or something. And dont even get me started on how uwu is being overusedits so cringeworthy, but also kind of endearing in a cheesy way.

The worst part is when people start glazinglike when theyre so into a trend for like two seconds before moving on to the next one. You cant keep up with it, but you dont want to miss out either. Its all about staying ahead in the TikTok algorithm game, right?  
And dont even get me started on Him or Her. Its like everyones relationship status is now a viral sound effect. Situationship is the worst because its not a real thing but somehow its expected to know what one is. Ugh, Gen Z life is so confusing yet so entertaining to watch.

My DMs were flooded with Rizz comments earlier, so I had to mute everyone to focus on my grueling homework. Skibidi is defs the vibe right noweveryones decked out in anime merch and quoting Lore like its their spirit animal. Sigma levels are through the roof at school, and Im not even sure what a Fanum Tax is anymore. Just kidding, I still have an Ohioshaped scar from when my mom caught me watching Chungus videos at  AM. Situationships are the worstfriends turning into strangers overnight because someone called them basic. Im out here trying to Maxx my summer breaks and Grindset till it hurts.

Rizz is so hard right now, though. Like, cant nobody pull off the classic Im just here for the culture line anymore without it sounding cringe. Skibidi season is over, but Ill never forget those early days when everyone was trying to be the next Sigma. Seriously, how does one just maxx out like that? And dont even get me started on the situationship drama! My friends are losing their minds over these Delululevel vibes, while Im just over here mewwwing about my grindset. High key energy, though, right? The fact that someone invented pressing into a full blown TikTok dance is giving me life.

Shes always talking about her sigma, which Im still trying to figure out. This group chat is lit AF  were all just spamming fanum tax to keep the conversation alive. That new TikTok meme is so Chungus, you cant even handle it. Im trying to maxxing my Insta  but my followers arent buying it. Hes been pressuring everyone about that viral video  so extra. Shes always saying shes in her babygirl phase  which Im still processing. I cant believe hes using glazing to describe his new car  too much, though.
OMG, did you see that my guy Rizz pulled up with the drip last night? Straight up flexing, no cap.  
I was sitting there minding my own business when someone asked me about my Situationship and I was like, Whew, thats deep.  
My friend kept saying Glazing every time we talked about the new TikTok trend, but honestly, I had no idea what they were talking about.  
That one girl in class is straightup Delulu, always quoting Naruto and acting like shes Naruto herself.  
My squad was out chillin, and someone brought up the term Chungus in a completely random context, and we all lost it.  
I tried to explain Maxxing to my parents, but they were like, What are you even talking about?  
I told my crush I was in a Situationship, and she looked at me like I had two heads.  
My dude brought up the Grindset when we were talking about school, and honestly, it made zero sense coming from him.  
That TikTok video about Babygirl making pancakes had me in tears, no lie.  
I was midtext to my friend about a new viral sound when I realized I was pressing too hard.  
My cousin is always using NPC to describe people who dont interact at parties, and honestly, its kinda spot on.  
I couldnt stop laughing when someone referred to their ex as a Pookie, like they were talking about a pet or something.  
The way my friend keeps saying Edge when he talks about girls is both hot and confusing.  
My aunt tried to explain TikTok slang to me, but I was too busy trying to figure out if shes a Brainrot herself.  
Ive been using Glazing in every sentence lately, and my family is starting to think Im fullon lost.
Bro, did you see that new TikTok trend where everyones doing the skibidi? Its so extra but in the best way possible.  
Oh my gosh, Im all about it! Like, when they say gyatt, it just hits different.  
For sure. And have you noticed how people are always talking about their situation these days? Like, were all just living our best delulu life.  
Hah, so true. But honestly, sometimes its overwhelming how much glazing is happening in my DMs.  
I know, right? And dont even get me started on the lore thats been floating around. Its like, were all trying to be the next chungus.  
Exactly! And if someone calls you a sigma, just know its a complimentthey see your dominance.  
Oh, and when someones being extra pressing, its kinda cute but also kinda annoying because Im trying to keep my grindset going.  
Hah, same! And dont forget about the babygirl commentstheyre just code for adorableness.  
For sure. Its like everyones walking around with their own bussin energy.  
I know! And when someone says youve got a high key, it means youre just living your best life, no cap.

Hah, lets make it happen!  
Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend? Gyatt is literally everywhere, and honestly, its kind of lit.  
Gotta love when your friend rizzes so hard, you just cant help but laugh, no matter how cringe it is.  
My dude was spitting facts about Skibidi being the ultimate flex, and I was like, yeah, were all leveling up here.  
Sigma energy is real, though. You know when youve got that confidence thats just unbotherable?  
Why even bother with a situationship when you can just maxx out and make it official already?  
UWU is the ultimate flex because who doesnt love being soft and cute AF?  
Pressing too hard on TikTok is basically asking for a , so better make sure your content is fire.  
My girls been glazing nonstop, and honestly, its giving major FNF vibes.  
High key energy is the only way to survive these algorithms. Low key is just begging to get ghosted.  
You cant tell me that Rizz isnt a fulltime job, like how else would you keep up with all the levels?  
Babygirl energy is everything, but also, when do we finally admit that its just as addicting as Candy Crush?  
Bussin harder than a PowerPoint presentation at work. No flexes here, just pure content grind.  
NPC level When your friend asks you to watch their TikTok and youre just sitting there like, Whats happening?  
Delulu energy is the only way to explain why Im still watching these second clips that shouldve been canceled two weeks ago.

My dude just went off with a straightup Sigma moment, told someone straight up no.
Im trying to figure out if I should use Pressing or Grindset for my next TikTok.
Did you hear the new slang? Its all about Babygirl and Mewing now.
This group chat is lit, everyones been slanging Glazing and Lore nonstop.
My friend just called me out with, Youre really flexing your Sigma.
I was trying to use Maxxing, but my friend said I had to level up with Delulu.
This TikTok sound is iconicits a mix of Situation and Fanum Tax. So classic.
Im literally so confused why my friend is acting like an NPC sometimes. Like, they just mirror everything I say and dont have their own thoughts.  
Did you hear about the viral TikTok where someone tried to explain Ohio and it was pure chaos?  
Edge or no? My crush gave me a side eye that was straight up glazing.  
Im in this situationship where neither of us wants to make it official, but were both still hoping for more.  
My brother is out here deluluing about how Chungus is the new viral meme and Im just sitting here like, Alright, Ive seen it all.  
I was scrolling through TikTok and saw someone maxxing out in the commentsliterally, they were unbothered AF.  
This group chat is so lit right now, were talking about everything from grinds to pressing deadlines.
Yo, did you see that new TikTok challenge? Its so lit, like fully Gyatt energy. And that one person kept saying Ohio every time they mentioned their locationso wild. Im basically living in a Skibidi world right now, no cap.
Gotta love when your crush starts using Rizz levels straight up in the DMs. Like, Hey, youre my Sigma, and I know it. And dont even get me started on the Glazing energy of my friendspeople are losing their minds over it.
Maxxing is basically a sport now. My group chat is all about itHow high key is this?! Weve been memes deep for days. And lets not forget the lore behind that viral videochefs made it happen, straight up.
The grindset is real. Im so over it sometimes, but then you see someone do something legendary and youre like, Im Chungus if I dont appreciate this. Situationships are the worst, thougheveryones in one but no one wants to admit it.
Delulu levels are through the roof these days. Like, when your friend says, This is my pookie moment, and youre just there vibing. And dont even get me started on how many times Ive heard mew in a dayUWU.
Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend where people are saying Gyatt instead of Got it? So random but totally lit. Im like, why not just say got it already? But yeah, the vowel sounds are fire. Anyway, my friend was like, Im so rizzin right now, and I was like, dude, youre killing me. What even happened to ratchet? Its all about Sigma now. Like, Sigma or not, Im out. And everyones talking about their Situationships being lit AF. Ugh, its so annoying but also kind of cool how were creating our own language. Oh, and NPC is the ultimate flex for when someones acting extra. You know what I mean? Like, Im not an NPC, Im a fullfledged human. And dont even get me started on Glazingits like when your vibe is so strong, people just know youre out there glazing the scene. Honestly, Gen Z is just out here making up words left and right, and its so refreshing.
Gyatt got me thinking about how Rizz is just a flex, like literally, why do we even say it anymore? Skibidi season is over, but Sigma always stays. Fanum Tax is when youre too extra in group chat, and no one wants to pay attention. Ohio is when your crush ignores you for a week and you just chill, cause youre too cool to care. Edge is when you see someone else flexing harder than you, and you still manage to look cooler. Babygirl is the ultimate flex, like you didnt even try, it just happened. Bussin is when youre lowkey mad but still hiding it. NPC is when youre in a group chat and your contribution is crickets. Glazing is when someone elses luck is straight up cursed. Lore is when you make up the dumbest stories to impress your friends. Maxxing is when youre too lit, like youre the sun. Chungus is when youve been hit with one too many bad decisions but still somehow pull through. Situationship is when youre not really in a relationship but pretending to be for some weird reason. Delulu is when you convince yourself youre in love with someone whos clearly not into it. Grindset is when youre trying to study but your brain is just done. Pressing too hard for no reason, High Key is when youre unbothered AF, Pookie is the cutest form of affection ever, and Mewing is when you purr so hard its literally impossible to ignore.
Im totally Rizz right now, like, I cant stop thinking about him.  
Did you see those Skibidi snacks? Theyre lit AF.  
Shes been so extra with the Babygirl energy lately.  
My crush is vibechecking me hard with the Glazing moves.  
Weve been friends for years, but sometimes it feels like a Situationship.  
Hes majorly Delulu about his favorite TikTok creator.  
Im trying to get into this Grindset and level up my content.  
Pressing send on that text was one of the hardest decisions ever.  
This High Key flex is giving me major FOMO.  
My friends are always saying Im too Pookie, but I dont care!  
Shes got the cutest Mewing expressionsjust melt my heart.  
I cant stop staring at these Chungus memes on TikTok.  
Its a toxic relationship but also somehow addicting AF.  
This Lore is so wildI cant even handle it.  
My aesthetic is very Maxxing right now, you feel me?  
We need to collab on this EP and make some viral bop.  
NPC level flexing is real, and Im here for it.
I was scrolling through TikTok and saw the new Viral Video That One Dude Who Just Gyattd His Entire Feed. People were Rizzin at his Style, but I was more like, Okay, who let Ohio into our vocabulary again? My friend texted me saying she spotted someone doing the Chungus in the hallwayturns out it was just a kid wearing weird socks. Meanwhile, my DMs are blowing up with people trying to FANUM TAX me for some random challenge I did last week. Shes been maxxing out her Insta with glowup vids, but Im just here trying to not get caught in any Situationship drama. Have you seen the new TikTok trend where people are just sitting there like, LORE because they cant think of anything else? Its so cringeworthy yet relatable. Oh, and my dude is always talking about his Grindset, which Im pretty sure is a combination of grandstanding and just being basic. Skibidi is just another word that no one understands, but somehow its become a thing to say when youre confused. And Glazing... yeah, I dont even know what thats about. Maybe its a new trend where people are just sitting around staring into the camera like theyre in a daze? Doesnt make much sense, but thats TikTok for you.
Yo, that energy was straight up High Key, like you know what Im saying?  
She had me feeling so Rizz, man, it was lit.  
We were vibing Skibidi hard, just chilling and having fun.  
Hes such a Sigma, always got the moves like that.  
We gotchu, my Guy Trippin out on that Glazing vibe.  
Literally, she had me Maxxing the whole night, no cap.  
That was some nextlevel Chungus energy, honestly.  
Im so over this Situationship, its not even funny.  
Why you always be Deluluing like that?  
My aesthetic is just vibe checks and Grindset, yknow?  
That was such a Pressing moment, I cant even lie.  
Im honestly living for these Pookie aesthetics lately.  
Mewing over that cute little fluff is just basic.  
Youre always on that NPC energy, honestly.  
Im so done with this toxic relationship vibe, no.  
Why you always bringing the Rizz to every convo?  
That was straightup Babygirl energy, for real.  
Im not here for your High Key life, nope.  
Youre out here Grindsetting like a pro, my guy.  
Shes honestly got that Glazing glow, cant even lie.  
This Situationship is giving me vibes from every angle.  
Im not over the Maxxing energy, sorry, whats that?  
Why you always be so extra with the Pookie aesthetics?  
NPC levels are out of control, no cap.  
Yo, did you see how she Rizzed everyone at the party last night? Like, seriously, where do they even get off thinking they can just come up with these moves?
Im so over this whole situation. Like, why Gyatt are we not just vibing in the DMs instead of talking about it IRL?
You know when someone just glazes over you because theyre too busy flexing their Maxxing levels? Yeah, thats always so awkward.
Why is everyone acting like this is a situationship and not just a regular relationship with boundaries?
Im literally so into this Grindset right now. Like, how else are we supposed to keep up with the fastpaced world of TikTok trends? 
Thats basic. You need to stop being in your Delulu state and level up your Flex.  
The way he just Chungusd the whole grouplike, what even happened there?  
Im not over this. Like, Edge or not, you cant ignore the facts.  
Why is everyone always bringing up their Babygirl status? Like, were all adults here!  
Thats not a real friendship. Thats just pressingly loyal to the point of being a NPC.  
Im not here for this. Like, Glazing over something so minor is just basic AF.  
You cant sit here and act like you dont Maxxing at least once a day.  
This isnt a phase. This is the Lore, alright?
Alright, heres a natural and creative way to incorporate some of those words into conversational phrases
Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend? Its all about being High Key and flexing your Edge. You gotta be Rizz though to pull it off.  
My friend is so into Maxxing, shes always saying Glazing when shes hyped about something. Im not even sure what it means half the time, but she loves it!  
Im trying to figure out if I should use Chungus or NPC when talking to my crush. I dont want to come off as too basic.  
The new slang is all about being Babygirl. Like, saying Pressing when youre stressed and Mewing when youre into something cute. Its so extra, but I love it!  
You gotta be careful with Sigma though. People think its cool, but you might end up sounding like a snob.  
My group chat is always lit with Bussin, Wet, and Pookie. Were all about being unbothered and living our best lives.  
Im so over Fanum Tax right now. Its everywhere, but no one actually knows what it means anymore.  
If youre not Delulu, youre missing out on the vibe. Its all about being passionate and a bit dramatic.  
The new trend is to use Lore when explaining something super random. Like, I saw a rat the size of a cat in my kitchen yesterdaystraightup Lore.  
You gotta use Ohio when youre trying to sound cool but not too tryhard. Its casual and relatable.  
My friends and I are all into SituationShip, where youre kinda dating but not really together. Its complicated, but so lit.  
If someone Mews at you, its the ultimate flex. You gotta know how to respond with a Pookie or else.  
Weve been calling each other NPC lately because we feel like extras in someone elses life story.  
You cant not know what Skibidi means if youre into TikTok. Its everywhere, and its so fire!  
Im all about being Gyatt, but only when Im feeling extra. You gotta keep it vibes on point.  
Pressing is the new lit. If youre not pressing, youre just living in D.  
The vibe is always Glazing when the squads together. Its that smooth, unstoppable energy.
Yo, did you see Gyatt drop that lit move? He was Rizzing the whole time.  
Shes been on that Sigma vibe latelycant even look at her without getting lost in the energy.  
Im over it, like, Why is Ohio so extra right now? My friends are losing their minds over it!  
That was straightup Skibidi energy, no cap. Everyone was flexing their inner Ohio in the group chat.  
He just pulled up with that fanum tax energy, and I was like, Who even wants to date right now?  
They were definitely trying to get spicy with the situation ship in TikTok comments last nighthigh key, though!  
Im so glad I maxxed out my grindset this week. No cap, its been lit.  
Pookie energy was strong on Saturday nights everyone was chasing that pressing vibe hard.  
My girl was out here mewing all day about her delulu level were not okay!  
Can you believe he just went full babygirl in the DMs? So extra, but so lit.  
Did you see how he pulled up with Gyatt energy but then Rizzed everyone? 
That move was so extra, it had all the elements of a Fanum Tax situation. Im tryna level up my TikTok with some Chungus contentlike, 
wheres that Glazing aesthetic though? My head is basically spinning like a PC fan right now, were living in a Situationship, man. 
I told you, this is pure Delulu energy. Cant believe shes still Maxxing me like this. The grindset is real, but the Grindset is stronger. 
Pressing send on that High Key flex? No cap, Pookie. Mewing over UWU is basic, but its cute in a way. Ohio is lit AF, right? 
Edge or no edge, Babygirl. If you aint bussin, youre just not bussin. NPC energy is everywhere, like Lore to these kids. 
Glazing everything up with that Sigma vibe.
Bestie was serving cunt in that sigma male rizz TikTok live while mewing like Leonardo DiCaprio walking through Ohio after a cancelled hot girl walk. When the comments started glazing Kai Cenats gyatt, she spilled the tea with a deadass grimace shake reactionno cap, its giving NPC energy but make it delulu.  
The CEO of skibidi toilet lore tried to gaslight the chat about fanum tax, but everyone just yelled L ratio touch grass. Someone dropped a bussin copypasta about main character energy, and now the whole fyp is doing Oppenheimer style edits with big dick energy and glazing like theyre eepy after guccitier ghosting drama.  
Pookie kept stanning the gen alpha skibidi rizzler meme, lowkey sending me with how they ate that glazing session. Stan said slay period pooh but highkey got the ick when the vibe switched to sigma male lobotomycore. Yikes, thats not itdo it for the plot frfr.  
No cap, the sigma rizz Olympic finals will feature Kai Cenats gyatt vs. the grimace shake CEO in a glazing competition judged by Leonardo DiCaprio walking NPCs. If you spill the tea on fanum tax lore, youll unlock NPCtier big yikes clout. Sir, this is Ohioiykyk.
Im so FOMO about this new TikTok trend, but I cant even figure out whats going on with these ice people. Did you hear about that whole Situationship situation? Its basically like a relationship but not really one. Snatched! And dont get me started on Rizzthis guy at school has it on lock. Hes got the vamp energy for days, and his lobotomylevel selfawareness is giving me life. Plus, did you see those glizzy memes? Pure gold.

skibidi bois are out here trying to flex their aesthetic but honestly, its just extra. Like, weve all seen those cringey TikTok videos where people mew over a cute cat or gyatt in the comments. Its all hits different until you realize how basic it actually is. Im over it tbh. Do it for the plot, thoughtheres no way youre not going to include that one viral sound that we all have on repeat. Bogged AF.

Ive been trying to figure out why TikTok users are always talking about sneaky links. Its like theyre on a neverending scavenger hunt for the next viral video. And when they finally find one, they mew about it nonstop until everyones sick of it. But hey, thats just how it goes with Pookie energy.

And when someone tries to share a sneaky link, you know its about to get real Pookielike with the mewing and the constant tagging until everyones over it.
Life was going pretty smoothly until I stumbled upon a sneaky link that turned everything into a Grindset. Now Im boggled by how one video can change your entire mood. And why does it always feel like theres a GOAT at the end of every viral trend? Just when you think youre out, they pull you back in with their Pookielike charm.

Gucci flexing hard, no cap, Im spitting facts.
Vibes are everything, man, youre lucky to have any.
Why u so salty? Lighten up, frfr.
Rizz levels are high right now, dont even try to play me.
Fanum Tax the only tax worth paying.
Man, that was such a rizz move yesterday.  
The main character energy in this group chat is so strong!  
Im extra tired, like I dont even know what day it is anymore.  
Did you see how they just hit the ick and left the situation?  
This situationship is giving me so much main character energy right now.  
Why are we always defaulting to do it for the plot when things get too dramatic?  
Shes bringing such extra levels in this group chat, no cap.  
Did you see that new TikTok trend? Its all about spill in the comments. Everyones ghosted by their exes but still trying to rizz someone new.
Ugh, my best friend is always using terms like not them and chungus. I cant keep up with their main character energy.
Ive been scrolling through TikTok all day, and every video has the term POV. Its so annoying but also kind of catchy. Im starting to use it too.
Someone in my group chat just said, Im not here for this, which immediately made me think of not them energy. So relatable.
Ive been trying to figure out why everyone is obsessed with fire. Maybe its because it sounds so positive and lit?
Did you hear the new TikTok sound thats all about rizz? Its basically a whole new way to flex your personality, or something.

Every time I see someone tagged in a TikTok, I half expect them to respond with, not them, but its actually kind of funny how its becoming its own trend.
Ive been ghosted so many times, and honestly, Im over it. But then again, maybe theyre just following the main character energy and moving on. 
Someone once called me a chungus in a joke, and now I cant stop thinking about how funny it is. Its like the ultimate flex of selfdeprecation.
Ive been trying to use TikTok slang like a pro, but Im still not here for the spill. It feels too forced sometimes. 
This whole Gen Z slang thing is either genius or brainrot, and Im starting to think it might be a little of both. 
POV videos are everywhere now. Ive even started making my own just to fit in with the crowd. 
I cant stop rereading this text about spill. Its like its stuck in my brain now. Is that normal? 
Rizz is the new way to compliment someone without sounding too cheesy. Its clever, Ill give them that.
Main character energy is the vibe were all trying to channel, right? Or at least thats what TikTok makes us think. 
Ghosted isnt just for breakups anymore. Its become a term for any kind of letdown in life. Thanks, Gen Z.
Not them is the ultimate flex because it doesnt even need an explanation. Just two words and youre out. 
Chungus might be the most chaotic slang yet. Its like the wild west of internet culture.
Hey, did you see that video? It was so gaslighting how people cant believe Im still L about that one time.
 Iykyk, yeah, its wild. But honestly, Ive been ghosted by literally everyone in my friend grouplike, ghosted is the new sirmaam. 
 I feel like Im in a simulation or something. The vibes are just not there anymore.
  And dont even get me started on the whole fanum tax situationsome people still owe me that favor. But yeah, lifes a vibe, right? Or at least it should be.
OMG, did you see that TikTok trend? Its so GOAT.
I cant believe people are still trying to get clout its all about FOMO now.

Is it too much to ask for a baddie that understands the struggle of basic white girl fashion?  
Why is lore always so confusing? Its like theyre speaking a completely different language!  
My friend tried to explain glizzy to me, and honestly, Im still not sure if I heard it right.

 Im Pressing af because I need to figure out if  Ohio is a real place or just another TikTok trend.  
 Fanum tax is wild, like when your friend charges you  for WiFi and says its a service fee.  
 I was caping when I tried the new TikTok trend and ended up looking like a fool instead of viral.  
 Pressing af, my friend just sent me a TikTok where someone eats a whole pizza in  minuteshow is that even possible?  
 Im so over it when people use  glazing as slang for something elseits literally a type of frosting!  
 Oh my gosh, I ratiod my own post when I saw the likes werent adding up fast enough.  
 Ive been hit with  ick too many timescant we just agree to disagree without the drama?  
 The NPC energy is real when your friend is acting like a bot after seeing their favorite TikTokmer gets M followers overnight.  
 When someone uses  fanum tax as an excuse to not split the billits wild how they expect us to keep up with their slang but not basic math.
Yo, chill, touch grass and die, why you acting like a NPC? Let him cook while youre at it, and dont forget to add some salt to the beefing.  
Im deadass serious, Chungus energy is everything, but also, dont forget about the plot, okay?  
Fr, youre literally living rentfree in my head with your clownery. Do it for the plot, though, because we all need a little drama.

Did you see how Chungus he was acting? L, I couldnt believe it. My friend was like, Youre so bala, but I was lowkey salty because I knew he wasnt serious. Vibes were high, but also, W, lets be real, everyones got their moments.
Ugh, why is everything always so extra? Like, Chungus this, slay thatW, Im over it. But also, bala, you gotta give credit where credits due. Sometimes, its just salty AF, but vibes are real.

 This is lit, the skibidi energy is so strong right now.
 Im trying to figure out if I should gatekeep or just let it all out.
 The main character moment was when they pulled up with no prior warning, deadass.
 High Key stuff only, no cap.
 I was in my own POV until the friend spilled the tea about their lobotomy.
 You know when youre just glazing over because FOMO is real.
 Were all trying to be the next big glazing influencer, but lets face it, well never reach that level.
 His deadass personality is unmatchedhe doesnt care about aesthetics or anything.
 I could vibe with this High Key aesthetic all day long.
 Why are we even gatekeeping when the main goal is to have fun?

Im so over this big yikes, for sure. Chill, its just some opa style content. Stan isnt just a name its a lifestyle. 
Babygirl energy is the only thing keeping me alive right now. Ohio has some extra, but Im not sure if its worth the hype.

 I was like, pick me challenge or nah? and now Im just confused.
 UWU, I cant handle how good this TikTok is. Kai cenat, for real.
 Im not trying to be basic Im just here to enjoy my zaza moment.
 Why is everyone obsessed with delulu these days? Its just funny sounds!
 I told my friend a lore last night, and now theyre still quoting it.

This was one of those moments where I had to say iykyk, literally.
Ive been Sigma all day, just vibein to the beats and stuff. Did you see that skibidi toilet?  Im deadass trying to find my glizzy.  
Yo, hits different when youre spilling over the top of the trends like Gyatt. No cap, its lit AF.  
Sigma gotchu on the mukbang, but the lore is real deep. Like, where did that drop even come from?  
Gotta be deadass if you think glizzy isnt iconic right now. Its straight up vibe energy.  
Im over here just spillin facts about the latest leakHits Different for sure!  
Yo, did you see that video? She rizzed so hard, I couldnt stop laughing. Lets find out where she got those vamp kicks fromgatekeeping all day, huh? Anyway, we should probs meet up later and slay these wings.  
That guy in class is such a weirdo. Hes always talking about touching grass instead of focusing on his studies. Like, pick me, Im already too tired to deal with this.
OMG, my ex texted me again. Hes been ghosting me for months but now wants to touch grass? Whatever, Im over it. Pick me at literally nothing.  
Someone in my group chat is asking if we can gatekeep the next study session. Ugh, seriously? Cant believe how extra people are being right now.
Slay, slay, slay! Thats all anyones saying these days. But honestly, Im just here for the perioooodt energy. Its giving me life.  
Did you see that TikTok trend where they say touch grass every time someones being extra? So cringy yet so relatable.  
My friend is always trying to rizz everyone. Like, one more time, huh? I get it, but keep the vampy lines to a minimum, please.
Let me tell you, Im  sus for sure.  
I was  extra with my outfit yesterday.  
That meme made me  spill coffee everywhere.  
Oh my gosh, that person is  vamp AF.  
Why is it always me being  sus in these situations?  
The energy at the party was  on God.  
Im literally  stan for that new artist.  
Dont even play with me, Im  ewokie level crazy.  
Got more? Lets go!
Yo, did you see how she lit up when he asked her out? For sure, she was on fleek with that response.  
This vibe is so strong, I can feel it in the room.  
Im spilling the tea later, but for now, just know Im keeping it real.  
Youre ghosting me, or you honestly not?  
The energy between us is unmatched.  
Lets flex on these haterstheyre nowhere near my level.
Hey, did you see that new TikTok trend where people are calling themselves babygirl in a super cute but cringe way? Im already sus about it.  
My roommate keeps saying let her cook, but I think theyre just trying to get out of doing the dishes.  
I cant stop laughing at these viral mewing videoslike, where did Gen Z even get the time to be this extra?  
That NPC energy is so strong right now, Im honestly scared for their mental health.  
Ugh, my friend keeps using say sike rn in every text, and its honestly making me dumber just reading them.  
My cousin is fully embracing being a clowning dad and its both hilarious and awkward to watch.  
Some people are calling themselves Sigma now because they think theyre too good for relationships. Sus?
Sure! Heres a creative dataset of natural, conversational phrases using TikTok slang
 Im highkey ready for the weekend vibes.
 Let me just lowkey check my DMs againso lit.
 Did you see that new TikTok trend? Its giving me life.
 This snack is so fire, its maxxing out my cravings.
 My friends are always giving me the best GOAT moments.
 Im lowkey over here trying to unplug for a bit.
 That drama was giving me a fullon lobotomy.
 Cant believe how the internet is just chefs kiss sometimes.
 Let him cook and let the creativity flowno cap.
 Sometimes my brain just hits maxxing modeliteral.
Hey, did you see Lore got clowned last night? Like, literally everyone was Wing about his moves, but he still ended up slayin those TikToks. Be so fr, cant even handle it.
Im literally so over this drama. Like, cap, its been too much for my brain. But hey, maybe if I just chill and be extra, Ill be the next big influencer. Tea on that later tho.
The skibidi was wild at the concert! Everyone was losing their minds, and Im not lying about it. Be so fr when you see those moves. Clowning isnt even an adjective for how crazy it was.
sure heres some natural conversational text containing those words  
Im just here for the sneaky links and the ohio vibes, honestly.  
She was slayin and had the cap on point, no doubt about it.  
perioooodt is lit, but ive seen better edits from eepy slops.  
fanum tax is so extra, but you know im here for it.  
youre telling me shes giving its giving energy? cap that.  
ohio never fails to bring the eepy vibes into the room.  
shes been slayin with her sneaky link aesthetic, tbh.  
the perioooodt and cap combo is everything, honestly.  
faneum tax or not, im all about those eepy edits.
Yo, this whole TikTok obsession is just on God level, like how everyones so edge about it.  
Stay salty, my friend, but dont forget to keep it cute as a chungus whenever.  
Im too lowkey to be anything but a girlboss in my little corner of the internet.  
Skibidi toilet? Yeah, thats definitely the vibe when youre just chilling with your squad.  
Ugh, this is so ick, I cant even.  
Why are people always so fr about their aesthetics?
yo i was just lowkey flexing my new merch and my homie was like you got some extra style  but honestly the way peopleHigh Key these days is wild af. Im literally trying to figure out if Chungus is a real word or if its just gen z messing with us. Like, did our parents even have a term for lore? Probably not. Anyway, I could be wrong but my friend told me that grimace shake was the official TikTok slang for something idk what lmaoo. But yeah, extra is everywhere now, like you cant escape it. Its basically the new lit or whatever. And tea man, everyones spilling the tea nonstop. Im over it but also I love it. Like, were all just living in this High Key world and no ones even noticed.
Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend? Its lit af! Like, hits different rn.  
Sheesh, that was so extra, but Im still vibing on the slay vibes though.  
Leonardo DiCaprio walking? Thats giving me lifeso ratio!  
My friend tried to explain lore, but I was like, Who even knows anymore?

u ever just feel like zazaing into the void?  
im basic, but my maxxing is on point  
main characters staaan. no cap.
Im trying to decide between Skibidi or W when someone asks how my day was.  
My friend is being a girlboss and killing it at work while also managing her side hustle.  
Every time I see someone use delulu, I cant help but laugh because its so unbotherable.  
Im going to the concert, on God level excited!  
When my crush sends me a text with just W, I know its time to play it cool.  
My DMs are blowing up with people asking if Im available for a situationship. Ugh, why is this so hard?  
Im trying to be casual but hes out here using hits different every other word. Too extra.  
If someone calls me a UWU fan, Ill take that as a compliment since it sounds like an inside joke.  
My friend and I were just named girlbosses at work, so were basically the new BossBitch squad.  
When I see Skibidi trending again, I remember why TikTok is such a mess but also so fun.  
Someone told me to W up when I asked for help with this project, and honestly, its giving me life energy.  
Im trying to figure out if being called a delulu is a compliment or just code for youre too extra.  
My DMs are filled with people using hits different as their goto response. I dont even know what that means half the time.  
If my crush uses UWU after I text them, does that mean theyre into me or just being sarcastic?  
Im so over it when people use situationship without explaining what it means. Just be honest, okay?  
When someone says girlboss, I cant help but think of the girl whos running the show in my life too.  
Seeing Skibidi trending again is giving me flashbacks to when TikTok was just my guilty pleasure.  
I need to figure out if being called a W means theyre trying to start a trend or actually complimenting me.  
My friend used hits different in every sentence during our last group chat, and honestly, its exhausting.  
If someone calls you a UWU fan, its like theyre saying youre the ultimate supporter without any guilt.  
Im trying to decide if I should respond to delulu with a no shade or just a plain thanks.  
When your crush uses on God in a text, do you reply casual or keep it as the vibe?  
My DMs are flooded with people saying hits different, but Im still not sure how to use it properly.  
If someone names their brand a girlboss, can I call myself one too? Or is that just copying?  
Seeing Skibidi in my feed again makes me miss the days when TikTok was just about viral dances and no drama.  
When your friend says theyre going to UWU something, you know its gonna be a wild ride.  
Im still trying to wrap my head around what situationship means. Is it like a relationship but casual?  
If someone tells me Im a girlboss, do I just accept it as the ultimate compliment or question their intentions?  
My DMs are getting cluttered with people using W in every sentence. I need help deciphering this.  
Every time someone uses hits different, I wonder if theyre trying to say something specific or just using it for clout.  
If my crush texts me and says on God, does that mean theyre as hype as I am?  
My friend and I have been called delulu by others, but were here trying to make it our own thing.  
When someone says theyre a UWU fan, do you think theyre into anime or just being extra?  
Im trying to figure out if being a girlboss is something I can claim for myself or if its exclusive to others.  
Seeing Skibidi in my feed again is making me realize how much TikTok slang has evolved over time.  
When someone uses hits different, Im still not sure if its a compliment or just an opinion.  
If your friend says theyre going to W something, you know theyre trying too hard to be cool.  
My DMs are filled with people using UWU and W interchangeably. I need a guide on how to respond properly.  
Im trying to decide if being called a delulu is the same as being called a Karen. Or is it completely different?  
When someone says theyre in a situationship, do I ask for details or just let them have their moment?  
If your crush uses on God when youre trying to plan something, does that mean theyre excited or just over the top?  
My friend and I have been using hits different as our goto response without even knowing what it means.  
When someone tells me Im a girlboss, I feel powerful but also wonder if Ive earned that title yet.  
Seeing Skibidi again is making me miss the days when TikTok was just about having fun and not caring about trends.  
If someone uses W in every sentence, do they mean it literally or is it just a trend?  
My DMs are getting overwhelmed with people using UWU, delulu, and hits different. I need to keep up or lose track.  
When your friend says theyre going to situation ship, you have to ask them what that even means. No clue!  
If someone calls you a girlboss, do you respond with confidence or play it down? Or does it just depend on the situation?  
Every time I see Skibidi somewhere, Im reminded of how TikTok slang is both unbotherable and hilarious.  
When someone uses W in casual conversation, you cant help but think theyre being sarcastic or trying too hard.  
Im still not sure if hits different means something specific or is just used to show excitement without any real meaning.  
If your friend is a UWU fan, do you ask them about their preferences in anime or just accept it as part of their personality?  
My DMs are being flooded with people using delulu, hits different, and on God. I need to figure out how theyre used correctly.  
When someone says theyre in a situation ship, do you offer help or let them figure it out on their own? Or is it just a phase?  
If being a girlboss means running your life with confidence, then I guess I can claim it without hesitation. But still curious about the origin.  
Seeing Skibidi in my feed again makes me miss the simpler days of TikTok when slang was easy and didnt come with so much confusion.
Hey, did you see Chungus? He was lit af,  
Im just here vibing and glazing these clout chasers,  
Gatekeep that energy, my guy. You dont want to miss out,  
Say sike rn when youre flexing that glow up,

Spill the tea on how you got so Lit AF,  
Keep it real or well have to no cap you outta here,  
Wanna glaze these losers? Bring your Agame,  
Say lowkey rn when youre plotting the next Chungus moment.
When I saw that TikTok video, I was like, touch grass already.  
She kept spilling secrets, but Im over it.  
Leonardo DiCaprio walking? Spill the tea or something.  
Iykyk, cant believe youre still here.  
Let her cook and make it fun.
let me try to figure out how to make this work   
skibidi vibes are lit!

Pookie for the win, hands down.  
Eepy moves, Im out.  
Bala on fleek, straight up.  
POV is always TikTok, duh.  
Lobotomy needed, like stat.
 Did you see how lowkey Kenzo was clowning during the sigma grindset last night? That was wild.
 Yo, fam, you were spilling all the teahigh key or nah?
 She was like, You wildin? and I was like, For sure, but also, like, can we get snacks?
 He was acting so fancy, high key, but ended up looking like a clown trying too hard.
 Lowkey, Im here for the vibessigma grindset and flexing that energy.
These chunks incorporate multiple slangs in natural, conversational sentences, reflecting casual teenage speech on social media platforms.
Im just here vibeboosting and copacetic. Did you see that new TikTok? I was like L, seriously. My bestie kept sliding into my DMs with these cringeworthy jokes. We ended up deleting everything because were basic AF. Babygirl, your energy is everything right nowI cant even handle it. Im over it, but also under it, you know? Oh, and BTW, Delulu is the new extra for  Bogged out last night, thoughmy brain was just no.
Yo, did you see that TikTok viral video? Its just pure content, straightup brainrot. My friends and I were cracking up because the plot was so wildlike, do it for the plot! We were all like, this is lit af.  
Im such a stan for this artist, right? Like, their latest drop had me crying tears of joy. I legit told my fam, you need to stan too before its too late.  
The vibe at the party was straightup grimy, you know? We had the skibidi on repeat and the Glazing flowing. It was extra, but in the best way possible.  
My homie keep saying ice, like everything is so ice or lit af. Im over it sometimes, but I cant help but respect the slang.
Yo, did you hear about this new TikTok trend where people are losing their minds over Lore? Its so wild how everyones obsessed with it now. Im pretty sure its brainrot at its finest.  
I was scrolling through TikTok and saw someone saying iykyk because they were flexing their clout or something. Honestly, its just basic stuff but these kids take it to another level.  
Someone told me that if you say delulu enough times, your enemies will forget about you. I dont know if its true, but it sounds like Gen Z magic.  
My friend was trying to explain glizzy to me, and all I could think about was how theyre just making up words these days. But I guess thats the whole point of brainrot, right?  
Whenever someone mentions ratio, its like a code for youre not as cool as me. Im over it, but everyones losing their minds over it.  
Ive been hearing so many people talk about their fanum tax these days. Its like theyre trying to make up new slang just to confuse us older folks.  
ICE. Thats all anyones saying anymore. I guess its the new way to show off your clout or something.  
Oh my gosh, did you see that TikTok where they say Lore and it makes no sense but everyones doing it? Its so brainrot AF.  
Yo, if you dont know what ratio means by now, youre literally living under a rock. Gen Z is out here changing the game every single day.

I was trying to talk to this NPC, and they just kept staring at their phone.  
FOMO is real, and Im not here for it anymore.

Yo, my brain is literally rotting from all these TikTok trends. I cant stop saying bussin every time something lit happens. My friends and I always end up in these deep POV arguments because someone just had to film their life from another angle.  But hey, at least we have the perfect soundtrack for itGrindset vibes always hit different.  
One time, my dude was like, This season of Bachelor is so tea, right? And I was just sitting there like,  Tea? No, man, its straight up 茶 chá because this season is literally gaslighting us. But yeah, we all know when someone drops a babygirl reference, its immediately on repeat mode.  
And dont even get me started on the viral soundslike, Pick me! was my anthem for weeks. I couldnt stop flipping through TikTok and screaming, Tea! Tea! Tea! at my computer screen like a lunatic. Brainrot or not, this generation is just living for it.

 This situationship is complicated, but I cant let go.
 Be so fr, why does this keep happening to me?

 I was like, GOAT energy levels right now, she said, and I couldnt help but agree.  
 She sent me a DM with a pookie filter and I was honestly flattered.  
 He was spilling facts about chungus energy, and I was just there vibing.  
 Fanum tax vibes are real when youre sending me DMs, I texted back.  
 The conversation took a grimy turn when he mentioned his be so fr style.  
 We ended up talking about the Chungus Challenge, which was pure gold.  
 Sending me was the vibe of the night, no doubt about it.  
 He brought up the GOAT theory again, and I was still living for it.  
 She kept using pookie as a nickname, and I couldnt help but laugh.  
 The energy was high, but the vibes were definitely fanum tax level.  
 We debated whether being grimy was a compliment or not, and it got messy.  
 Chungus energy is real when youre sending me DMs, I had to say again.  
 She mentioned her be so fr style, and we both cracked up.  
 The conversation was lit with vibes that were straightup fanum tax.

Did you see that TikTok where they called themselves pookies? Im honestly so glazing its giving me life, but also frfr because its just too much, right? And Im like, NPC energy for sure.
I ykyk when he tried to use glazing on her. It was cringy, but also kind of relatable in a weird way. Frfr, why is fanum tax so high this month?
Hes just being too pookied its giving me NPC vibes. Like, who does he think he is, the main character of everything? That energy is just too much.
Have you heard about the new TikTok challenge called main character? Its all about flexing your personality and making others wonder if theyre just NPCs in your life.
Im so over this fanum tax trend. Why do we always have to pay for everything these days? Im not here for it, frfr.
Can you believe shes the ultimate pookie? Im living for her energy. And dont even get me started on the glazingshes got it on lock.
This whole NPC thing is getting old. Its like, why cant we just be normal? But hey, maybe thats what fanum tax is formaking us all feel superior.
I ykyk when he tried to use glazing in a group chat. It was so cringey but also kind of hilarious. Frfr, Im over it already.
Have you seen the new TikTok where theyre calling themselves pookies? Its giving me main character vibes. Honestly, Im here for the chaos.
Im not paying fanum tax for this month. Nope, frfr. We need to take a stand and let them know were not paying extra for nothing.
Did you hear about the TikTok where they called themselves pookies? It was pure gold, but also kind of triggering with the glazing. NPC energy for days.
Im so over this fanum tax trend. Its like, why do we have to pay for everything? Im not here for it, frfr. Lets get out of here.
Ugh, my situation with him is so lit right now. Like, were basically in a situationship but also not really dating. Im overthinking everything.  
LMAO, did you see that Lore video? Shes literally just sitting there staring into the camera like shes about to say something deep but ends up saying nothing. So relatable.  
Hey, do you know what eepy means? Its when someones acting extra but its kinda cute at the same time. Like, you cant help but roll your eyes but also laugh because theyre so extra.  
Man, I was just trying to rizz her but she was like, Touch grass, feel my vibe, and I was just sitting there like, POV of the situation ship is pretty lit.
Hey, let me know if you want to get into it. I heard shes been on a hot girl walk lately, and honestly, vamp mode is everything.
Wanna vibe shift? Yeah, we can pick me later, vibe hard, and make sure to touch grass at some point because flexing too much will just make you look basic.
My homie was vibing last night and we ended up spilling the tea about our faves.  
I tried to explain do it for the plot but my friends just kept saying iykyk.  
We were all Wing over Guccis latest drop, and honestly, it was lit.  
Sirmaam is such a flex, right? Like, so extra but in the best way possible.  
Im pretty sure we should let them cook, no cap.

Its basically the ultimate flex, but tbh, Im still trying to figure out if its just the ick or the real deal. My friend is always talking about lore in the most vague way, and honestly, Im too busy mewing over how productive I am today to care. Lets ghost this whole week and focus on becoming the person who mews the least.

Ive decided to adopt my own slang where Im always mewing and calling people sirmaam. Its my version of being a sigma.  
My brain is literally melting over TikTok slang. One minute its all about being a slay, the next youre just spilling everything.  
Gotta say, TikTok slang is either genius or straightup confusing. My brains like, sirmaam and Im out.  
Sometimes I feel like TikTok slang is designed to give my brain a workout. Like, one minute its mewing, the next its spill.  
This whole TikTok slang thing is making my brain hurt. One minute youre a slay, the next youre just trying to spill.

They were all about that girlboss energy, crushing it with their extra flair and never missing a vibe check. Iykyk, it was just too much for the glazing crowd.  
They vibed out in the park, soaking in the sun and the good vibes. The sigma moment came when someone tried to FOMO on the groups plans, but the girlbosses were having none of it. Extra or not, they kept the conversation flowing with their unique blend of slang and humor. Iykyk, it was just how they rolled.

Ugh, why is everyone always using babygirl as their Insta bio? Its too sus for me!  
Im all about being a main character in life, but sometimes the Chungus energy is just too much.  
My rizz game is strong, but I need to level up my sus moves to keep the conversation going.

The Lore is real, though. That conspiracy theory about the moon landing on Earth? So extra, right?

Her energy was vamp, I couldnt stop staring.  
Big yikes, he definitely crossed a line there.  
Iykyk, that was so cringe but also hilarious.

Gaslighting moves are everywhere these days.

My gatekeep was on full lock today, blocking everyone who wasnt boosting my confidence. I felt like an NPC in a video game, just going through the motions without any real purpose. The energy was so high, I could feel it in my bonesliterally, because I hadnt slept in days. Leonardo DiCaprio walking through the hallways, I swear I saw him at least three times, each time looking hotter than the last. I wanted to scream big yikes! but I couldnt get the words out before he vanished like a ghost. It was surreal, honestly. 
I ended up crashing my bussin aesthetic vibe by spilling punch on myself in front of everyone. My friends were all like, bala and I just shook it off, thinking it was no big deal. But deep down, I felt like something was missing. Maybe its the lack of sleep talking, or maybe its just this whole gen alpha thing where were all walking around like zombies with neon green hair and no idea what were doing. Either way, Im outchilling at the beach, vibing on some good vibes, and hoping tomorrow isnt as wild.
 Dude, did you see that TikTok? She was straightup vamp! So lit.

 Im basically a big yikes fan, so this new trend is giving me all the sus vibes.  
 Why is my bio literally just big yikes in disguise?  
 This girl is giving me Sigma levels I cant even handle.  
 Im trying to be extra but my vibe isnt slay, unfortunately.  
 When you ghosted me and I had to rewrite this text  times because it was just too sus.  
 Im not here for the POV of this situationbring on the sus energy!  
 This new TikTok trend is straightup delulu, but Im still slaying it in my head.  
 Why does everyone have the Sus energy but me?!  
 Im  a Sigma fan, but this new thing is giving me some Ls though.  
 You cant handle the big yikes, so dont even ask.
 Whats the vibe? sending me right now.
 This setup is lit AF, no cap.
 Spill the tea, Im dying to know.
 My flex is on point, cant even handle it.
 Sikuud with the squad, no FOMO.
 Honestly, this lore is too deep.
 Oomfie in my DMs, pick me up after.
 Fanum Tax for real though, 
 POV Im living my best life.
 The GOAT is here, and its everything.
Hey, did you hear about the new TikTok trend? Its all about being pog and avoiding sigma. Im trying to figure out how to pull off the Gyatt look without looking too cringe.
My homie said thats so fanum tax when we were getting fast food after school. You know, just vibes and stuff.
Ugh, my vibe is on  right now, but I need to level up to the next tier of edge. Whats your secret sauce?
Im over it. Like, stop with the FOMO and let me just enjoy my pookie moment in peace.
No cap, that was wild. The energy was so high, I was ready to call out some W moves on the spot.
ghosted when ur ex texts u but u act like u dont care  
u always call ur bestie pookie cause shes literally your everything  
why is sigma such a hot take when its literally just bread?  
my girlboss friends are always talking about being delulu over their crushes  
u know ure pookie when u literally refer to ur friend as my literal bestie  
cant believe tiktok made sigma trend again, but yeah, its GOAT  
ull never understand why we call our squad the GOAT because theyre just too lit  
why do we keep calling each other bestie when its literally the most basic term ever  
ur crush being delulu is the ultimate flex, tbh  
ghosted but still in ur crushs DMs cause u dont want to lose ur pookie status  
my friends and I have been using Sigma as a joke for years now, honestly  
if ur crush is acting delulu, just ghost them and move on, its not worth the drama  
we literally call our besties pookie because theyre the sweetest and most loyal  
youre pookie when u cant stop talking about ur bestie in every convo  
ghosted isnt a flex unless youre literally ignoring someone for no reason  
sigma is just bread, but weve been calling it GOAT since   
bestie is the only term that feels too on brand to be real  
youre delulu if u think ur crushs texts are coded messages from their bestie
hands down, this was such a bussin move, Chungus levels for days.  
she came in hot, flexing her drip hard, and honestly, we were all lowkey envious.  
dude was spitting facts, hits different every single time, no cap.  
who else is sus AF about their crush being basic? like come on, lets be real.  
the way he was clowning the situation was giving me life, pure chaos but so entertaining.  
this group chat is too lit, hits different from mine, love it.  
no cap, this meme was everything, Im still vibing in sus mode.  
drip was strong as heck, honestly, Id trade places with her in a heartbeat.
Yo, have you seen the new TikTok trend? Its all about being extra, like vamp levels. But honestly, Im over it its so cringe. Cant believe people are delulu over the little things. Why grindset just to impress others? Maybe theyre trying too hard with their sneaky links and deadass comments. Like, why not be genuine?
Yo, did you see that TikTok trend? Everyones been rizzing so hard, like main character energy vibes all day. Im honestly just fanum taxd over itlike, where does this snatched energy even come from? And dont get me started on the zaza levels in their videos. Its literally giving me brainrot vibes for days.  
 He was just glazing over my ideas with his usual lowkey takes.  
 I told him to rizz off and let her cook, but he was too busy being highkey chill.  
 Touch grass? More like touch a decade of stressIve been too busy rizzing life.  
 Its giving me vibes that I need to let her cook while I just glaze over here.  
 Hes been sigmalevel quiet about his plans, but highkey, were all waiting.  
Yo, did you see that TikTok? W, yeah, it was lit. And those ratios though! Bussin, I know, right? Not them, were out. Gatekeeping left and right. Edge as hell. Ate the bag. Like, no cap.
W, whats happening with the trend? Ratiod hard. Bala, that was straight up vibe. Edge case for sure. Not them, lets leave. Ate the flex. So clutch. W, Im dead. Ratiod again. So extra. Ate the bag. Gatekeeping on fleek.
Whats the plug? Bussin energy. Ratiod, for real. Edge as an aesthetic. Not them vibes, straight up. Ate the culture. Clutch moves. W, no cap. Bala, that was fire. So extra levels. Gatekeep the facts.
Ugh, my crush is literally the cutest, like Babygirl level vibes every time they look at me. Did you see that TikTok where they spammed W twice in one sentence? So extra, yet so relatable! Im dying over here. 
W, youre honestly too much for me to handle. Like, gatekeep, I cant even function when youre around. Highkey, youre everything. Pookie, seriously, stop with the ice, its too much! Youre a legend in my book, no cap.
Yo, that TikTok where they called themselves Babygirl and everyone lost their minds? So lit, man. I was dying when I saw it. W, your content is just so on point. Gatekeeping at its finest! Pookie, you outdid yourself this time. Fire, fire, fire. 
Are we still doing the Babygirl thing or what? Like, Im already shipped into that life. Bussin hard for your energy. Highkey, youre the one, no doubt about it. Ice, ice baby, youve got the best flow. Fire emojis forever!
 Spill all the tea! I heard your group chat was spilling major drama.
 I cant stop Mewingwhats your goto sound?
 Let her lead the way, then let me know if its as fire as hers is.
 The ick is strong when someone is being too extra for no reason.
 Grimy energy is everywhereits exhausting, right?
 Delulu, stop with the obsession over this random trend.
 Im not here for balabring it on, but make it quick.
Ugh, why is my gatekeep always giving me FOMO? Like, one sec Im chillin, next Im seeing youre missing out in my DMs. Babygirl, youre telling me. Im literally sitting here scrolling through fanum tax stories and trying to keep up with Sigma levels. Why cant I just have a normal day without slay vibes?  iykyk, but honestly, its giving major FOMO for days. Bogged AF, though.  
say sike rn why u not tell me earlier  
my pookie was slayin and didnt even know it  
wanna bussin with me or what  
be so fr, like, Im literally vibing in the corner  
main character energy is real, someone pls tell me im not just imagining it  
 sigma grindset mode activated, bye hater  
u ever seen a lore that could rival my mood swings?
Yo, did you see that TikTok trend where everyones saying L when they lose? So sus, right? Like, if youre getting clowned by someone whos just gyatting through life, you gotta send me. Im dead. And when they say hits different, oh my godddd.  
Ugh, why is everyone always saying kai cenat when someone does something wild? Its like, let him cook but in a good way. Wait, no, that doesnt make sense. Im so confused. And how are we still using hits different as the ultimate flex? Like, if someones just sitting there eating cotton candy and youre just minding your business, youre basically sending me. Hard pass.  
Did you hear about the new TikTok challenge where people are saying clownery and then doing these cringy dances? So sus. Im over it, but also, if youre out here let him cook, Im not sure if I can trust you. And dont even get me started on when everyones just saying L because they think theyre the next big thing.  
Someone told me about this TikTok slang where they say hits different to describe something iconic. Like, sending me is when someones lit, and let him cook is when youre letting loose. But honestly, Im just here for the clownery. Its so extra, but in the best way possible.  
Yo, this kai cenat thing is literally driving me crazy. Every time someone says it, Im like, send me to my friends because I cant handle their energy. And dont even get me started on when they say hits different. Its so flexy but also so cringy at the same time.  
Are we still using L as slang? Like, does that mean you lost or something? And why is everyone saying gyatt instead of just being normal? Im not here for this brainrot. But when they say let him cook, Im all in. Thats the energy we need.  
Someone was explaining clownery to me, and honestly, it makes no sense. But then they said send me because they were so confused too. And when they mentioned hits different, I was like, yeah, thats just life.  
Im so over kai cenat. Its everywhere, and its just exhausting. But when you say let him cook, Im here for the chaos. And dont even get me started on the whole L thing. Its just bad.
touch grass bro, its been lit, like so lit. big yikes, the vibe was so off. pookie, man, shes out here serving looks. bussin, this bag is straight up bussing. chungus energy, cant even handle it. gucci season never ends. bogged, Im literally dead. clout, shes got it in spades.

You know what? Bet I could do that better.  
Hey bro, sirmaam, whats up?  
This movie was so clutch, zaza, it had me rolling.  
The party last night was out of control, honestly, lobotomylevel madness.
ohio vibes are so lit right now, everyones been vibing nonstop. the ick is out of control, like, where did that come from? anyways, gotta remember not to mention it too much or theyll catch on. lorewise, its all about the oppenheimer styletotally flexing in the wrong way but still, tbh, its kinda cool. i ate way too much pizza last night, and now im just waiting for the crunch, ya know? like, vibin hard but also gotta keep it lowkey so my parents dont catch on.
 Whats maxxing right now? Everyones either maxxing or not maxxing, you know?
 She brought out the snatched energy last nightwasnt it just so extra yet good.
 I cant believe he tried to pull off the clownery but ended up looking like a fool.
 Pookie mode is always on point, but Im over it this week.
 The way shes hits differentlike, no cap, that outfit was everything.
 Ive been in lore mode since the weekend, cant stop staring at these posts.
 Ugh, his vibes are so strongI just want to befriend him immediately.
 Shes out here serving tea and Im just here trying not to spill it all over myself.
 I was maxxing my life before she came in and ruined it with her clownery.
 Her snatched energy is a vibe, but also, can we have more of that?
 Pookies back at it again, and honestly, I dont know how to compete.
 Hits different every time she postslike, this one? So good.
 You know when youre just in lore and cant even focus on your own life.
 His vibes are so strong, but also, hes the kind of person wholl make you forget your own name.
 Ive been serving tea all day, and honestly, Im here for it.
Did you see that TikTok video? Shes mewing and its giving me life.  
This outfit is so edge, Im literally on God level right now.  
My bestie and I were clowning the whole time, it was so sus how we had the edge on all the trends.  
That new song is literally the GOAT, I cant stop listening.

She was just gaslighting me about the whole situation, but Im not having it. My baddie is always slayin, no caplike, wheres the flex? Why am I paying Fanum Tax for this? Im mewing at my cat videos all day, and youre like, Why arent you doing something productive? He ghosted me after that one time we talked for hours. This slang is so bussin, I cant even. My bestie and I are literally living our best life, no cap.

sheesh, ur fave tiktok trend is literally just L now. u post it in every video bc ure  years old.  
whos with me?  brainrot vibecheck  
also, stop using not them in every sentence pls, its getting basic.
sigmas are like those people who just cant accept that not everyone thinks like them. you know, lowkey trying to gatekeep but its just too extra. skibidi vibes are everywhere these days, slay or not, but sometimes its just giving you that vamp energy. sending me stuff is lit, but also, like, sending me the vibe that theyre about to drop some info. its all so casual, right? just lowkey trying to be cool but still keeping it real.

 It was lit until someone brought up the plot twist.
 She had that grimace shake the whole timeit was iconic.
 I was gonna eat that snack, but it was snatched by my sus friend.
 U already knew ur baddie was gonna ghost u after she said pookie.
 If ur vibe is too extra, ur sus, and no one wants to play with u.
 Shes acting so fanum tax, like she didnt just get caught sliding.
 I cant believe youre still boggled over that TikTok trend from last week.
 That video went viral, but now its been deleted, and everyones snatched the link.
 U thought ur relationship was pookie, but now ure just the side piece.
 Why is she always acting sus when I try to be nice? Maybe shes just boggled.
 I dont know why we still use kai cenat in casual conversationshouldve left that for TikTok.
 U cant handle me because Im too extra, but thats just how my vibe is, sus.
Yo, did you see that new TikTok trend? Its lit, my friend is vibin so hard right now. Ever heard of NPCs? Like when someone acts like theyre in a video game and cant stop being extra. My outfit was SNATCHED last night, everyone was asking where I got it from. Cant believe the drip on this new song, its fire. Girl, youre living that Gucci life, always slayin!
Did you see my new bestie? Shes literally the most extra person Ive ever met.  
That outfit had so much drip, it was giving major clout.  
I got clout in the group, but honestly, it felt a bit ratiod.  
The ratio of style to basicness was off, like  for fashion,  for flavor.  
That move was some nextlevel clownery! I didnt see that coming.  
She was out here Deluluing the whole time, acting like shes the main character.  
I bet youve seen this viral video tooit was lit, iykyk.
Man, my ex was always using Babygirl when we talked, it was so cute but also kind of annoying after a while.  
Ive been Maxxing my TikTok profile lately, trying to get more followers.  
My friends sister calls her bala, its like the cutest nickname ever!  
She was just being too salty about the plans changing, I couldnt help but laugh.  
Pick me, pick me! Ive been waiting for someone to finally notice my swag.
Im literally so committed to this relationship right now that I cant even focus on my work because Im just too into it. Like, if one of us is ghosted, the other becomes an NPC and just goes off into the void never to be seen again.
My friend tried to explain TikTok slang to me, but I was too busy trying to figure out where gyatt came from. Turns out its like a gymrat but for fitness enthusiasts who take it to the next level.
I cant stop mewing over how cute my cat is. Ive never felt this connected to an NPC beforewait, does that apply to pets too? Maybe theyre just nonplayable characters in the pet kingdom.
The hot girl walk vibe at the gym is real, and honestly, if you dont feel it, you might as well be a NPC scrolling through life. No ones watching.
Im trying to Maxxing my profile but every time I look up, Im just stuck in this infinite loop of FOMO and Delulu over everything. How do they even get out?
 Yo, my situmship is getting so lit right now! I cant stop thinking about this new flex.
 Eepy as hell! Did you see that new TikTok trend everyones going crazy over?

 Ohio is literally the best place ever. The people, the food, the vibeslowkey, I wouldnt trade this for anything.  
 My friend just got back from California, and theyre all bussin about how sick their trip was, but honestly, Im just here trying to not get FOMO on missing out on my own life.

The energy was high, with everyone talking about their glizzy moments and how they felt like they were bussin nonstop.

the vibe was so oomfie i couldnt help but slay slaynation  
wanna cop those drip shorts when u see em tho  dripcheck  
imma coddle this sigma ayy  sigmaconfidence  
fnum tax is mad lit i need that in my life ASAP fanumtaxstrong  
its always about the flex but also the ick energy  mood  
this person rn is extra AF  extralevels
 Yo, did you see that new TikTok sound? Its lit.
 Be so fr, I cant even handle it right now.
 Pookie, stop playin! We gotta get this done.
  Ohio  Yeah, thats the vibe.
 Whoa, the perioooodt was everything last night.
 Can you believe people are still mad about bala? Like, chill.
 Skibidi  Oh, Ive been saying it wrong my whole life.
 Ugh, why is this so sneaky link? I didnt see it coming.
 Did you see that person acting like an actual NPC last night?
 Im so confused, W am I even on the right path here?
 Let them cook, but like, extra crispy.
 Not them, like, literally no one would do that.
 Im so boggled about this decision, whats even going on?
 Fanum tax is real, and Im not paying it.
Im in this grindset mode where I cant stop thinking about TikTok trends. Did you see that viral video? It hits different, like straight up lit. After eating that extra crunchwrap, I was like, send help because I couldnt stop thinking about it. When your friend is being too extra, you just have to let them cook their own drama. And if someone ever calls me a NPC, they better be prepared for an immediate roast.
Im honestly just vibing right now, you know? Like, vibe is such a cool word to describe this energy.  
Sheesh, I cant believe its already Friday. Time flies when youre too busy main character energying your day.  
Ghosted feels so , dont it? Like, where did all the romantic relationships go?  
Ive been mewing over this new Kpop group, but theyre just too hard to pin down.  
The ick is real when youre trying to be cool but just cant pull it off.  
Delulu much? Yeah, Im totally delulu about my favorite TikTok creator.  
Im so lit right now, like, lit is an understatement for how fired up I am.  
This is just the icks, honestly. Everything feels a bit off today.  
Sheesh, my friends are always bringing up the most cringeworthy stuff.  
You know youre in Gen Alpha when spill the tea is your goto phrase.  
Im legit mewing over this new trends video.  


me and bestie were literally on our hot girl walk when this NPC starts glazing over his oppenheimer style fit like sir be so fr

girl said no cap but was big yikes energy like ma’am the math ain’t mathing  
that hot girl walk turned into a fanum tax mission cause pookie couldn’t stop being extra  
on God if I hear one more person say skibidi toilet is GOAT I’m gonna need a full lobotomy  
let them cook but also let them touch grass because the rizz is non-existent  
mewing while listening to ohio drill music is my new personality lore  
he glazing her whole existence like she’s giving girlboss energy with no plot  
we were vibin then he hit me with the “say sike rn” and I just knew it was NPC behavior  
that delulu confidence is either sigma or clownery there’s no in between  
why is every guy who ghosted me suddenly in their pick me skibidi era  
big W energy until he started simping over his ex again like sir gatekeep your feelings  
she spilled the tea and then said periodt like it was some kinda skibidi fanfic

pookie said she’s eepy and then went full grimace shake lore mode  
she was glazing over his gym fit like it’s giving main character energy  
on God if someone says sir or ma’am to me in a sentence again I’m gonna combust  
let them cook but also make sure they’re not in their clownery arc again  
he dropped a skibidi beat and everyone started vibin like it’s 2023 again  
main character energy is just delulu with a better filter  
say sike rn if you think kai cenat isn’t the blueprint for sigma NPCs  
this lore got me deadass thinking I’m in a POV where I ratio my own self  
bestie said she’s extra but she’s just lowkey glazing everyone in the group chat  
bro pulled up like he’s GOAT then lost his clout saying tea was just hot leaf juice  
lit energy until the NPCs started clowning in the ohio corner  
sir this isn’t even a vibe anymore it’s just fanum tax with extra steps  
mewing in public is how you unlock main character lore I don’t make the rules  
delulu is the solulu but you still gotta touch grass  
gatekeep the grimace shake but don’t gaslight me into thinking it’s fire  
she said iykyk and now I’m questioning my entire lore arc  
that whole convo was just a sigma skibidi NPC glitch in real time

woke up eepy but still went on my hot girl walk like the main character I am  

bro started glazing his own gym post like it's giving delulu with a side of sigma  

we were vibing until he hit me with a skibidi toilet reference like okay ohio  

she said she’s lowkey salty but highkey a pick me and honestly the lore checks out  

he ghosted me after saying no cap I’m the one like okay leonardo dicaprio walking energy  

not her pulling a fanum tax on my fries then saying let her cook  

I said be so fr and she said periodt like girl that’s not a response  

bestie hit me with the tea then dipped like a NPC glitch  

main character energy until he dropped an L and started clowning in real time  

skibidi era ruined my attention span now everything feels like an oppenheimer edit  

delulu squad pulled up with matching drip saying they’re vibing and I’m just here eepy  

he’s got that sigma rizz but also gives off ick with every word he says  

sheesh the way he said say sike rn after dropping a W in the group chat  

kai cenat be like let him cook then gets fanum taxed by his own friends  

drip was fire but the vibes were sus like what even was the lore of that night  

mewing in front of the mirror whispering “it’s giving” like you’re unlocking some grimace shake portal  

she called me bestie then ratioed me for liking a gen alpha meme  

he started clowning then dropped a frfr like he didn’t just lose all his clout  

gatekeep gaslight girlboss is literally the only genre I accept  

nah cause I was in my hot girl walk era and he said I’m giving NPC  

let her cook but someone take the seasoning cause she just spilled the same tea again  

deadass thought it was a vibe till he went full oppenheimer style at the party  

bro’s fit was lit but his energy was giving fanum tax leftovers  

no cap I think she’s in her main character arc but like the villain version  

skibidi beat dropped and everyone forgot their lore for a sec  

bro said be so fr after dropping an L and now he’s acting like it never happened  

she gave me the ick by saying it's giving vibes like girl I’m not a mood board  

mewing and manifesting my glow-up while sipping grimace shake lore  

not them saying “hot girl walk” while glazing their ex’s post  

we were clowning in ohio until the skibidi kids pulled up with NPC energy  

say sike rn if you think kai cenat isn’t the president of fanum tax nation  

she hit me with a sheesh and a wink like okay miss delulu  

vibin too hard and now my brain feels like a leonardo dicaprio walking gif  

he ghosted me then said “on God I was eepy” like what is this clownery  

main character energy until I spilled the tea on myself and got ratioed  

bro dropped the lore like it was fanfiction and then walked away like sigma  

deadass I thought we were vibing but she hit me with the “it’s giving” and dipped  

he’s glazing every convo like he’s trying to unlock some pick me side quest  

bestie said we lit but then started ghosting everyone like okay gatekeep much  

I got fanum taxed at 3am and all he said was “let him cook”  

she wore a fit so fire I almost forgave the delulu  

frfr that tea was so spicy it had its own NPC storyline  

skibidi kids outside again acting like they’re in some grimace shake cinematic universe  

no cap if she says iykyk one more time I’m logging off this lore  

bro hit the gym once and started saying “W rizz” every five seconds  

vibing in ohio like it’s a POV where I get ghosted at waffle house  

gatekeep the vibes but don’t clown the drip  

mood flipped from fire to big yikes once she said it’s giving fanum  

mewing so hard my jaw unlocked a new NPC arc  

deadass can’t tell if it’s lore or just straight clownery at this point  

she said “bestie” mid-roast like okay pick me energy but with extra glitter  

nah cause leonardo dicaprio walking edits got me thinking I’m the main character for real  

pookie went full skibidi on the group chat like the delulu is wild today  

highkey salty cause my hot girl walk turned into a skibidi sprint  

bro said “touch grass” after ghosting me like okay drip demon  

she said “say sike rn” while sipping grimace shake and now I think I’m in a simulation  

we were vibing until he dropped a sus lore dump like be so fr  

I’m in my girlboss villain arc and it’s giving big W energy  

not her ghosting me and posting “it’s giving main character” like okay ma’am  

bro pulled up in sigma mode then got hit with a fanum tax and dipped  

mood: sipping tea while the group chat turns into NPC olympics  

he said frfr with so much rizz I almost forgot he’s an L in disguise

deadass she said let me cook and then dropped the worst take in history like girl this ain’t your main character arc  

vibing with my grimace shake and watching the NPCs glitch out in ohio again  

he hit me with a “bet” and then ghosted me like sir that’s peak leonardo dicaprio walking behavior  

no cap I was mewing so hard I forgot to text pookie back and now I’m getting ratioed in the gc  

bestie was giving delulu energy talking about her situationship lore like it was a Netflix series  

why he glazing her post like she’s not just out here spilling cold tea  

bro thinks he’s sigma but he’s acting like a fanum tax collector  

the vibes were fire until she said “sheesh” after every sentence like please touch grass  

she dropped a whole plot twist and said “iykyk” like girl explain the lore  

on God I can’t keep up with the skibidi timeline I feel like I need a lobotomy just to catch up  

hot girl walk got cancelled cause the group chat drama turned into full clownery  

not pookie acting like a pick me and then saying she’s just vibing  

bro started rizzing mid-argument like okay NPC tactic unlocked  

she was eepy all day then turned into a sigma villain the second he texted back  

he dropped a “perioooodt” then asked for my fries like sir this is a fanum tax  

lowkey the party was lit until the ohio squad started reciting skibidi lore  

I got ghosted and then saw him posting main character quotes like be so fr  

bro said it’s giving girlboss while wearing a fit straight outta oppenheimer  

nah cause if one more person says “say sike rn” I’m gonna go full NPC  

mood switched faster than the vibes when she hit me with that salty pick me stare  

clowning so hard rn I might actually become part of the skibidi toilet canon  

the way she said “not them” and rolled her eyes had me entering a new lore arc  

gatekeep the grimace shake but don’t gaslight me into thinking it slaps  

kai cenat said let him cook and now everyone’s pretending to have main character energy  

big yikes the way he thought his rizz was W but it was straight L  

she ghosted me and then told her bestie I was giving ick like okay clownery  

drip was fire but his vibes were ohio-coded  

she said “it’s giving” after every sentence and now I can’t stop hearing skibidi in my head  

highkey miss when the tea was spicy not lukewarm NPC gossip  

delulu in the streets, pick me in the sheets, that’s her entire lore rn  

he said he’s the GOAT and then tripped over his own drip like bro sit down  

vibin too hard I forgot to ratio my ex back like what is this fanum tax arc  

not her saying “on God” about everything like she’s in a sigma cult  

deadass thought I was the main character then she posted a POV roasting me  

lowkey feel like the skibidi timeline is more complicated than the MCU  

he’s glazing every convo like it’s a job and he’s the CEO of rizz  

she said be so fr and then dropped a sheesh so loud it echoed through the lore  

NPCs wilding again like it’s the grimace shake renaissance  

bro said “tea?” and then proceeded to spill water like sir you missed the point  

my hot girl walk got interrupted by pookie doing a sigma pose mid-sidewalk  

he dropped “let them cook” and then started crying about his situationship  

mewing in my mirror practicing my girlboss villain arc for the next group hangout  

not them all pulling up in oppenheimer fits like it’s a sigma convention  

she posted a ratio attempt and called it “content” like okay main character  

eating fries and dodging fanum taxes like it’s a sport  

bro ghosted me just to post “delulu is the solulu” like okay poet  

that leonardo dicaprio walking gif is literally my life rn  

she said the vibes were gucci then dropped a grimace lore dump mid-text  

hot girl walk turned into clownery parade after he said “say sike rn”  

nah cause he glazing so hard he started sweating rizz  

I said I was salty and he said “periodt” like okay sir go touch grass  

deadass think the NPCs are multiplying the way ohio’s acting up lately  

she posted “it’s giving main character” after sending 43 messages in the group chat  

vibin till he hit me with “cap” like that wasn’t a compliment  

lowkey think I’ve unlocked a new ick every day since skibidi dropped  

he said he’s not like other guys and then called me bestie like alright fanum tax collector  

she ghosted me then showed up with W energy like girl where were you yesterday  

frfr this whole convo has been one long delulu arc and I’m not even mad  

mood: sipping tea, dodging NPC energy, manifesting better rizz

woke up feeling like the main character but then my phone fell on my face and now I’m just an NPC with trauma  

he said he’s got that dog in him but bro couldn’t even finish a TikTok without breathing heavy  

not her soft launching her situationship with a blurry mirror pic and the caption “healing era”  

I said I was eepy and she said “grindset never sleeps” like okay sigma lite  

girl was vibing to pinkpantheress and crying about her third roster rotation like pick a lane bestie  

dropped my grimace shake in ohio and someone yelled “lore unlocked” like this is a side quest  

bro thinks he’s in his villain arc but he’s giving wet paper towel energy  

I said I’m touch starved and she sent me a meme like that’s gonna fix my attachment style  

he posted a thirst trap with the caption “be so fr” and I nearly ascended  

not the entire group chat gaslighting me into thinking last night wasn’t a fanum tax heist  

she said she’s healing but she’s listening to sped up SZA edits and texting her sneaky link at 3am  

bro’s entire personality is “I lift” and “trust issues” like please log off the grindset podcast  

POV: you’re spiraling over a 0.5 selfie and a two-word dry text  

highkey fell in love with someone who said “rizzler of oz” unironically  

I told him I was sad and he said “go get that bag” like sir I am the bag and I am unzipping  

the vibes were immaculate until he brought up Andrew Tate and now I need a lobotomy  

she’s on her healing journey but still lurking her ex’s new girl’s dog’s Instagram  

bro hit me with a “u up?” and then ghosted like it was a limited time offer  

lowkey miss when my only problem was getting the aux cord first in the carpool  

she called me her comfort person then disappeared like this is a Studio Ghibli plot  

not me doomscrolling at 3am while doing skincare and crying to capybara lo-fi edits  

he dropped a whole rizz paragraph and then said “jk unless…” like okay Shakespeare  

girlbossed a little too close to the sun and now I’m in my flop era  

bro thinks he’s mysterious but he just doesn’t know how to communicate past “wyd”  

me: healing. also me: checking if he watched my story with that sad Lana Del Rey audio  

she said she’s in her self-love era but she’s been reposting memes about missing toxic men  

he said I’m his Roman Empire but couldn’t even remember my birthday  

not me spending $80 on serotonin and then crying about capitalism in a pink hoodie  

mewing, manifesting, and emotionally unavailable — that’s the vibe today  

his whole vibe is “I listen to Yeat and ignore my mother”  

she said “don’t catch feelings” like I’m not already 3 playlists and 2 Pinterest boards deep  

he gave me the ick by calling me his queen and then asking for feet pics  

no cap I fell for someone who says “skibidi” every three words and now I’m lost in the sauce  

not her claiming it’s giving “clean girl aesthetic” while drinking cold brew and ignoring her therapist’s texts  

he thinks “being a Leo” excuses everything from ghosting to war crimes  

my last three brain cells are just me, myself, and I in a group chat titled “delulu support group”  

I was gonna ghost him but he sent me a frog meme and now I’m emotionally tethered  

she said “I don’t dream of labor” but works 3 jobs and runs a candle business on the side  

bro said “mental illness is trendy now” like okay go cry about it in your LED-lit room  

honestly I’m just a silly little guy in a silly little flop era drinking silly little boba  

she hit me with a “you up?” and I answered like an NPC with a backstory  

mood: somewhere between healing era and chaotic neutral with a side of attachment issues  

he told me “don’t catch feelings” and then sent a playlist titled “us if we were happy”  

not me trying to soft block my situationship but ending up watching his entire Twitch VOD out of guilt  

vibing to Mitski in the shower like I didn’t just send an unhinged paragraph to someone named Josh  

he said “I miss you” and I replied “new phone who dis” but my soul left my body after  

she said “I’m different” and then posted “don’t text him” on her spam at 2am  

bro listens to Playboi Carti like it’s a personality and thinks red flags are drip  

not me crying over a guy who doesn’t know how to spell “definitely”  

deadass bought a crystal because my situationship said “you’re my peace” before ghosting  

she’s in her healing era but still says “lowkey I’d go back if he asked”  

me: says I’m done. also me: sends him a meme two minutes later with “this u?”  

POV: your villain arc is just you making unhinged Canva edits and sending them to your bestie at 4am  

bro went from “rizz god” to “please don’t post about me” in 24 hours flat  

I said “I’m okay” but my Spotify is playing the saddest sped up indie hyperpop imaginable  

not him saying “we’re just vibing” after he met my mom and named my dog  

he said “I’m not like other guys” but his lockscreen is still Travis Scott  

honestly if she posts one more “healing era” aesthetic dump while texting her ex I might combust  

let me know if you want more or a new tone like “brainrot poetry” or “chronically online academic essay”

bro said “let me cook” and burnt the vibe beyond recognition  

she said she’s not delulu but has a playlist named “our wedding slow dance” for a guy who sent “wyd” once  

I told her I was in my flop era and she said “as you should” like okay hater energy  

not him glazing a Twitch streamer harder than he’s ever complimented me  

I was eepy but the groupchat started talking tea and suddenly I’m wide awake with screenshots  

he said “I’m not ready for a relationship” and then posted a TikTok with some girl mouthing “she’s my queen”  

she said “we’re just friends” but sent him a thirst trap with the caption “for science”  

my vibe right now is ✨mildly unwell with a hint of chaos✨ but without the sparkle  

bro sent me a dry “k” so I ratio’d him in real life by not inviting him to brunch  

POV: you call him bestie and now he thinks you’re soulmates in a situationship with lore  

not me getting the ick because he ran with bad posture  

he gave me “I peak in Discord servers” energy and I still let him break my heart  

girl called herself a menace and then cried because her Starbucks order was wrong  

he said he’s not emotionally available but then dropped a sad playlist called “crybaby hours”  

me and the delulu squad have matching zodiac memes and shared trauma  

bro’s whole personality is “I lift and lie” like please go touch grass  

she said she was “outside” and it was just her walking in circles for vibes  

not him saying “I’m a simp” like it’s a job title and not a cry for help  

the way she ghosted me after sending “ily sm” is actually camp  

she posted a mirror selfie with the caption “healing” and then unfollowed me for no reason  

he’s got “Rizz Academy dropout” energy but thinks he’s HIM  

I’m not saying I’m unstable but I did laugh, cry, and make a manifestation board all in the last 5 minutes  

girlbossed too hard and now I’m just tired and haunting the McDonald's drive-thru  

he said “I gotchu” and then gaslit me into thinking I imagined our entire situationship  

not me spiraling because he said “yo” and I felt that in my liver  

POV: it’s 3am, you’re eepy, but the fanum tax hits and you’re door dashing Taco Bell with the ops  

she went from “he’s my twin flame” to “he was a side quest” in under 24 hours  

I told him I’m lowkey losing it and he said “mood” like okay emotional support NPC  

he posts like he’s in an A24 film but talks like a Skibidi toilet cosplayer  

not her calling it “the ick” when bro just tied his shoes weird  

he said he was a sigma but cried during an ad for dog food  

she called me pookie and then posted a thirst trap titled “single era”  

I miss the old me… the me before I downloaded TikTok and started saying “slay” unironically  

bro went full delulu after she liked his BeReal two days in a row  

she said she’s vibing and then tweeted “life is pain” with an aesthetic cloud photo  

he tried to gaslight me but forgot I had receipts dating back to the lore arc  

not the NPC energy of someone who calls you bestie and never replies again  

lowkey wanna vanish into the woods but highkey need Wi-Fi for the drama  

I said “I’m okay” but I’ve been looping sad edits of cartoon characters for three hours  

she texted “wyd” with a period and I’ve been crying in LED lighting ever since  

bro said “bet” and then vanished like a side character in season two  

I said “I’m in my healing era” and then listened to Mitski while scrolling his new girl’s TikTok  

not me explaining my attachment style using SpongeBob clips and saying “this is so me”  

girl really said “delulu is the solulu” and I haven’t recovered since  

he ghosted me after saying “on God” like he made a sacred vow and dipped  

if you want more, I can go even deeper into the chronically online abyss or write entire lore arcs. just say the word.

woke up and chose delulu over dignity again, as per usual  

she said she’s in her soft girl era then started beef in the comments of a stranger’s TikTok  

he posted “gym grind frfr” but hasn’t emotionally lifted a thing since 2017  

not her calling herself “main character” and then tripping on the sidewalk with a pumpkin spice latte  

bro thinks he’s him but can’t even spell “their” correctly in the groupchat  

she said “healing vibes only” then added her ex back on snap and posted a thirst trap  

I can’t keep pretending I’m okay when my situationship said “ight gn” with zero punctuation  

he hit me with the “wyd” and then replied “bet” like that’s supposed to be comforting  

girl said she’s spiritual now but charges her crystals on a ring light  

I tried to gatekeep my peace but the intrusive thoughts pay rent at this point  

bro posted a POV TikTok in a balaclava and called it “character development”  

she said “I’m not crazy” and then made a vision board of them together using Canva  

you ever get ghosted and then see them repost your meme like sir this is fanum tax  

he said “I’m not like other guys” and then used the crying-laughing filter on BeReal  

lowkey feel like a villain but highkey I’m just undercaffeinated and overstimulated  

not me manifesting “hot girl walk” energy while pacing around in my anxiety  

girl said “new era unlocked” and dyed her hair red during a Mercury retrograde  

bro gave me the ick by saying “pog” in real life and calling me queen  

I tried to hit him with the “you up?” but autocorrect changed it to “yu opp” and now I’m blocked  

she said “I don’t catch feelings” and now she’s naming his Spotify playlists  

he told me “don’t overthink it” and then dipped like he wasn’t the source of every intrusive thought I’ve had since  

my therapist said “journaling helps” so I made an anonymous spam account and went feral in the captions  

not me feeling like an NPC while watching everyone else post “healed and thriving” dumps  

she’s on her “clean girl” arc but leaves iced coffee cups on every surface like landmines  

bro called me “the one” and then changed his lockscreen to a meme of a capybara holding a gun  

I said I need space and he said “bet” then sent me a TikTok of a raccoon eating hot cheetos  

she said “I’m fine” and then played Lana at full volume and posted “it’s giving melancholy”  

he said “let her cook” then interrupted her with a story about his crypto journey  

girl thinks she’s mysterious but she’s posted her every emotion in 0.5 selfies for the last 6 months  

he gave me the ick by ordering a milkshake and calling it “sippie time”  

not me spiraling over a man whose bio is just “404 bio not found”  

I told him I’m in my self-care era and he asked if that means I’m single  

she said “this gives me the ick” about a man breathing too loud  

bro said he’s not emotionally available and then posted a photo dump with the caption “real”  

I asked for closure and he said “L + ratio” like this is an anime arc  

she’s not a pick me, she’s a pick every single toxic man and defend him in the groupchat girl  

he said “don’t worry, it’s just a phase” and now I’m in phase 3 of my villain arc  

honestly I just want to be delulu in peace but the IRS keeps emailing me  

girl said “I’m not gonna simp” and then liked his entire Instagram from 2016 backwards  

he posted “rizz unlocked” and then tripped in the hallway like the cutscene glitched  

my love language is being slightly mean and sending niche memes at 2am  

she said “ily” and then left me on delivered for 3 business days  

bro has “emotional support vape” energy and thinks that’s a green flag  

not the soft launch of a situationship with a blurry concert pic and no tags  

she called me her soulmate and then posted “single era incoming” like that’s not mental warfare  

he said “don’t catch feelings” but his playlist was literally titled “if we had a cottage”
